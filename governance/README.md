## Mission of devicetree.org

To reduce fragmentation, improve maintainability and increase multi-platform support in hardware description, by building on the existing standard for device tree which reflects the current best practices and technology. This standard will be supported by an open process that encourages wide community participation and industry support.

All members will have an equal vote on core decisions ensuring quality among all participants and industry-wide consolidation.
