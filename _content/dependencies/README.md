# Linaro Security Working Group

The Linaro Security Working Group (SWG) was created to help ensure an optimised
and efficient software ecosystem exists to support ARM open source Linux distributions
on security related topics, and to accelerate the delivery of high quality secure products
across the ARM open source ecosystem.

In order to enable applications such as securely booting a server or decoding encrypted media,
there needs to be a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). the SWG will be creating reference designs
showing how normal and trusted application code and libraries can be integrated within a particular
platform such as Android. Initial activities include the development of an open source reference
implementation of the W3C Encrypted Media Extension (EME) using platform security features for secure
media playback on mobile and digital home devices; and an open source reference implementation of
secure boot for the 64-bit ARM Cortex-A series processor cores to complement the ARM Trusted Firmware
open source project, targeted at server applications. In addition there will be work on security
features in the Linux kernel.
