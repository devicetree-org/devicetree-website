          - title: How do I comment and send patches for the Spec?
            content: |-

              Changes to the spec are proposed and discussed on a [public mailing list](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#devicetree-spec) and the source document is hosted in the [Devicetree Specification](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification) project on GitHub.

              You can find details about the mailing list and submission process in the [Readme](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/master/README.md) file.
