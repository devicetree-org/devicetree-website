P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #326 Ver 1

Title:         PCI Binding: Clarify address space allocation on PCI Bus

Author:        Mike Segapeli

Date:          March 11, 1996

Ed/Tech:       Technical

Synopsis:      The source for address space allocation on PCI Bus is not clear.

Doc & Version: PCI Bus Bindings to IEEE 1275-1994 Draft 1.6, 24 October 1995

Problem:       In the "probe-pci" algorithm it is not clear that address
               space will be allocated based upon the "reg" properties of 
               all the child nodes. 

Proposal:

In the PCI Bus Binding, Revision 1.6, page 16, line 39, change:

       ... for each distinct base address register (or register pair).

to:
     
       ... for each distinct base address register (or register pair) listed
           in each child's "reg" property.
