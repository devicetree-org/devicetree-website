P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #390 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          Increase the memory reserved for OF on 64-bit systems.

Synopsis:       Increase the memory reserved for OF on 64-bit systems.

Doc & Version:  PowerPC Processor Binding, Revision 2.0

Problem:        The current 32-byte area is insufficient on 64-bit
                systems, since the size of the registers have doubled.
                This area may be used for saving registers and executing
                a portion of the interrupt routine.   Since the registers
                are 8-bytes instead of 4-bytes in size, additional space
                is needed.  An extra 16-bytes is propsed for 64-bit 
                system implementations.

Proposal:       

Section 8.4 on page 22, line 19, add the following to the end of the
sentence: "or 0x1d0 to 0x1ff on 64-bit implementations."
