P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #: 379 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:         TFTP Booting Extensions Recommended Practice Open
               Argument Values

Synopsis:      Proposed Open Arguments Values for initializing a
               communication adapter

Doc & Version: TFTP Booting Extensions, Draft Version 0.6

Problem:       Need a way to initialize a communication adapter
               to a given speed and duplex mode for an Open Firmware
               boot

Proposal:

Per the last OFWG Meeting (6/25-26/96), the discussion about the
Network Recommended Practice reached the following consenuous
about the Network Open Method syntax:

open [bootp,][promiscuous,]siaddr,filename,ciaddr,giaddr,bootp-retries,
tftp-retries

This proposal suggests adding two more optional parameters that allow the
assigning of network speed and duplex mode.  There are cases where a
system may be attached to a hub where auto-negoiate/auto-sense are not
supported.  Open Firmware, through a user input, may have to initialize a
communication adapter what value to use for the network speed and duplex
mode for a network boot.  The following additional network parameters
for open method are suggested:

[speed=integer,] where 'integer' is a number representing Mbps

[duplex=mode,] where 'mode' is a string having values of "half"
               or "full"

Proposed Open Method syntax with addition of two new parameters:

open [bootp,][promiscuous,][speed=100,][duplex=full,]siaddr,filename,
ciaddr,giaddr,bootp-retries,tftp-retries
