P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #391 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:		Clarify Arguments to network Devices

Author:		Mike Segapeli

Date:		September 30, 1996

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	The format of the open arguments are not clear

Doc & Version:	Device Support Extensions Version 0.8

Problem:	The Device Support Extensions defines three arguments to the
                "open" method for network devices.  The "TFTP Booting 
                Recommended Practice" defines arguments to the "open" method
                of the OBP-TFTP support package.  Both sets of arguments
                are passed via the device's "open" method.  However it is 
                not clear which set comes first. 

                Also For the arguments "promiscuous, speed and duplex" it is 
                not clear whether the delimiting commas are needed if one of
                these arguments is not needed.

Proposal:	In section 9.2 replace:

                   "open network-device:[promiscuous,][speed=n,][duplex=mode,]"

                with

                   "The open arguments to a network device are defined as
                    follows:

                    open network-device:[promiscuous],[speed=n],[duplex=mode],
                                        [bootp],[siaddr],[filename],[ciaddr],
                                        [giaddr],[bootp-retries],[tftp-retries]
"

                
                Add the following sentence at the front of the paragraph
                starting at line 47.

                   "The open method of the device shall parse the first three
                    arguments and pass the remaining arguments to the OBP-TFTP
                    support package's "open" method."
