Subject: Item #420: PCI Binding: Correction to dma-map-in stack diagram

P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:420 Ver 1

Title:          Correction to dma-map-in stack diagram in PCI Bus Binding

Author:         Greg Hill

Date:           9-Jul-97

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Remove the ellipsis from the dma-map-in stack diagram

Doc & Version:  PCI Bus Binding

Scope:          All implementations supporting a PCI bus.

Problem:        The dma-map-in stack diagram is incorrect.

Proposal:

The stack diagram for dma-map-in on Page 12 Line 11 currently reads:

dma-map-in ( .. virt size cacheable? -- devaddr ) 

In the PCI context, the ellipsis is unnecessary and should be removed i.e.,

dma-map-in ( virt size cacheable? -- devaddr )
