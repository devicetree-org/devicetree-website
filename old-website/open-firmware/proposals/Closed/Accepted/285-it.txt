Subject: Item #285: Core errata: another minor error in appendix E

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #285 Ver 0

Title:		Bug in hacom.fth

Author:		Mitch Bradley

Date:		Aug. 30, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Return stack imbalance in "diagnose" example

Doc & Version:	1275 core errata

Problem:	In Appendix E, section E.6.3, page 220 of the core standard,
		in "diagnose", there is a "base @ >r" phrase without a
		matching restore function.  The original base is also
		never changed at all.  (This problem was reported by Mike
		Saari.)

Proposal:	

Add a section to the core errata document to change the following lines
near the top of page 220 of the core standard:

	base @ >r                       ( sensebuf )
	8 bounds ?do  i 3 u.r  loop cr  ( )

to

	base @ >r hex                   ( sensebuf )
	8 bounds ?do  i 3 u.r  loop cr  ( )
        r> base !

This corrects an error in the "diagnose" word of the "hacom.fth" file.
