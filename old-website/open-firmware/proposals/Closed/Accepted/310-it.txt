Title: Initialization of the Secondard Latency Timer Register for PCI-to-PCI bridges

Author: Tom Caron

Date: 1/26/96

Ed/Tech: Technical

Synopsis: probe-pci should set Secondary Latency Timer register for PCI-to-PCI bridges

Doc & Version: PCI Bus Binding to IEEE Std 1275-1994 Standard for Boot Firmware
	Revision 1.6

Problem:

    The current bindings specify how the Latency Timer register of
    a PCI device should be set during the "probe-pci" command but
    make no reference to the Secondary Latency Timer register found
    in the configuration header of PCI-to-PCI bridges.

Proposal:

    Add the following paragraph to the end of section 6:

	Set the Secondary Latency Timer register to largest value used
	to initialize the Latency Timer registers of all the children
	of this PCI-to-PCI bridge.
