P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #: 378 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:         TFTP Booting Extensions Recommended Practice Property
               Values

Author:        Bob Coffin

Date:          July 23, 1996

Ed/Tech:       Technical

Synopsis:      Proposed string values for "supported-network-type"
               and "chosen-network-type" properties.

Doc & Version: TFTP Booting Extensions, Draft Version 0.6

Problem:       Suggested property string values

Proposal:

Per the last OFWG Meeting (6/25-26/96), the Network Recommended
Practice added two properties to identify characteristics of the
network adapter/device in the device tree:

"supported-network-type" - all capabilities that the network
                           adapter/device can support

"chosen-network-type"    - network adapter/device selected mode
                           of operation


This proposal is intended as a guideline for determining
a value for these properties as new network technologies are
implemented.  The value is a string, as encoded with 'encode-string'
that would cover known basic communication link characteristics like
network type, data rate, connector type and duplexing mode information.
The proposed string format would use a delimiter, "," (comma) between
the values as shown below for parsing considerations:


      (BASIC NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS)

      Network       Data      Connector    Duplexing
      Type          Rate      Type         Mode
                   (Mbps)
