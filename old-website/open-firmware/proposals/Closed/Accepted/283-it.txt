Subject: Item #283: Core Errata: Alias expansion buglette

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #283 Ver 1

Title:		Aliasion Expansion Buglette

Author:		David Kahn

Date:		Aug 15, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical.

Synopsis:	"Otherwise" is incorrect on Page 39 case 'b'.

Doc & Version:	Core Errata

Problem:

In the path resolution procedure, on page 39 item 'b' of the core spec,
the clause 'otherwise' should allow case 'a' to fall through,
(omit 'otherwise').  Without the change, in the alias case,
the root node is never made the active node when the expansion
expands to a pathname beginning with '/'.

The informative boxed text is correct, the normative item 'b'
is incorrect because of the word 'otherwise'. In addition,
the test at clause 'a' could be inverted as a 'goto b' to
make it clearer that 'a' falls through to 'b'/

Proposal:	

> Isn't the the first section of 4.3.1 on page 38 supposed to fall through
> into b) on the top of page 39?
> In other words, the text that says:
>	b) Otherwise (when PATH_NAME begins with the "/" character),
> Should be written as:
>	b) If PATH_NAME (possibly augmented above) begins with
>	   the "/" character,

I agree with David's analysis.

-----------


Add the following to the pathname resolution algorithm
already included in the core errata document:

Change item 'b' on page 39 to:

	b) If PATH_NAME (possibly augmented above) begins with
	   the '/' character.

Change item 'a' on page 38 to:

	a) If PATH_NAME begins with a "/" character, go to step b).
