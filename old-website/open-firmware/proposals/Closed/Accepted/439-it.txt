P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:439 Ver 1

Title:          Correction to definitions of claim-phys and claim-virt
                in ARM Processor Binding

Author:         Greg Hill

Date:           26-May-98

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Clarify the text of the definitions

Doc & Version:  ARM Processor Binding, Version 1.0

Scope:          All implementations using an ARM processor.

Problem:        The definitions of the claim-phys and claim-virt client
                services are not clear.

Proposal:

claim-phys, page 14, first bullet:

The text currently reads:

The beginning address of the first page shall be (using unsigned comparison) 
greater than or equal to min_addr and less than or equal to max_addr.

The proposed replacement text is:

The beginning address of the first page shall be (using unsigned comparison) 
greater than or equal to min_addr and less than or equal to (max_addr - size) 
so that the allocated pages fall entirely within the range min_addr .. 
max_addr-1.

Similarly, claim-virt, page 15. first bullet:

The beginning address of the first page frame shall be (using unsigned 
comparison) greater than or equal to min_addr and less than or equal to 
max_addr.

The proposed replacement text is:

The beginning address of the first page frame shall be (using unsigned 
comparison) greater than or equal to min_addr and less than or equal to 
(max_addr - size) so that the allocated pages fall entirely within the range 
min_addr .. max_addr-1.
