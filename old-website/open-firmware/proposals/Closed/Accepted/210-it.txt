Subject: Item #210: P210 better branch descriptions

		P1275 Openboot Proposal			Proposal #: 210 Ver 1

Title:		Better Branch Description

Author:		Paul Thomas

Date:		April 22, 1994

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	Improve the description of branching semantics for FCodes

Doc Version:	D12

Problem:	The descriptions of how FCode branching works is confusing.
This proposal suggests wording to improve the clarity of the text.

Proposal:

1) 57:12 Under "FCode control transfer pair" it should read
	" b?branch Fcode-offset1 ... bbranch FCode-offset2 ... b(>resolve)"
Under "Example source construct" it should read
	"if... else... then".

2) 133:39 should read "...Tokenized by then, repeat, and else)"

For extra clarity:

3) 132:2 should read "Target of backward branch implemented by means of
bbranch or b?branch."

4) 133:34 should read "Target of forward branch implemented by means of
bbranch or b?branch."

These last two would leave no room for the mistaken notion that the implicit
branch in a do loop needs to have b(<mark) or b(<resolve) as targets.
