Title: Initialization of the Cache Line Size Register for PCI Bus Master Devices

Author: Tom Caron

Date: 12/17/95

Ed/Tech: Technical

Synopsis: probe-pci should set cache line size register for each bus master

Doc & Version: PCI Bus Binding to IEEE Std 1275-1994 Standard for Boot Firmware
	Revision 1.6

Problem:

    The current bindings specify how certain configuration registers
    for PCI devices should be set during the "probe-pci" command but
    make no provisions for setting the cache line size register.

Proposal:

    Add the following entry to the list of properties in section 4.1.2.1

	"cache-line-size"

	   This property shall be present if the function's cache line
	   size register is set to a non zero value and shall be absent
	   otherwise.

    Add the follwing entry to list of properties created by the "probe-pci"
    command.  This can be found in section 5, beginning on line 42.

	"cache-line-size"

    Also in section 5, lines 42 and 43 of page 16 specify how the Latency
    Timer registers should be initialized during a "probe-pci" command. 
    Before this paragraph a new paragraph should be added to describe how
    the Cache Line Size registers should be initialized.  This paragraph
    sould read as follows:

	On the host bus, set the Cache Line Size register for each master 
	to the system cache line size.  On subordinate buses, set the
	Cache Line Size register for each master to the value of the
	the Cache Line Size register of the bridge for that bus.  That value
	should be either the system cache line size if that line size is
	supported by the bridge or zero otherwise.
