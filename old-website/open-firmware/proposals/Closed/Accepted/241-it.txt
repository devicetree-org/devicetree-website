P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #241 Ver
<Auth-Vers#>

Title:          "legacy" devices

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           March 1, 1995

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       define default "reg" properties for legacy devices

Doc & Version:  PowerPC Binding 1.4

Problem:                legacy devices (without FCode) are not handled.

Proposal:

add a new section, as follows:

section:        Legacy devices

'Legacy' VGA and IDE devices that are implemented on PCI
will typically have the same "hard-decoded" addresses as they did on
ISA.  Such devices that have FCode can use explicit inidication of the
address requirements as noted above.  However, for cards that have no
FCode image, Open Firmware shall assume the standard address ranges and
shall create the "reg" property with these ranges, in addition to any
relocatable regions that have base registers.

For VGA (class code = 0x000100), the address ranges are:
        0x3B0-0x3BB             (I/O, aliased;  i.e., t=1)
        0x3C0-0x3DF             (I/O, aliased;  i.e., t=1)
        0xA0000-0xBFFFF (Memory, below 1MB, t=1)

For IDE (class code = 0x010100), the address ranges are:
        0x1F0-0x1F7             Primary Command Block (I/O)
        0x3F6                   Primary Control Block (I/O)
        0x170-0x17F             Secondary Command Block (I/O)
        0x376                   Secondary Control Block (I/O)

Note: For IDE, an encoding of the low-order byte of the class-code (the
"programming model" field) can be encoded to indicate the ability of the
device to operate in other than 'compatility' mode.  See the PCI IDE
Cotnroller Specification for more detail.
