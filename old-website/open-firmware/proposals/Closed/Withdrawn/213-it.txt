Subject: Item #213: Item #212: P 212 V 2 - Core Document errata: "xxSplit and xxJoin"


		P1275 Openboot Proposal			Proposal #: 212 Ver 2

		1275.0 Errata Proposal

(This is an expansion of the previous version of proposal number 212,
    which is hereby superceded.)


Title:		"xxSplit and xxJoin"

Author:		David L. Paktor

Date:		Mon 28 Nov 94

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	Clarify the phrasing in the Core descriptions of
		  lbsplit  lwsplit  bljoin  and  wljoin

Doc Version:	1275.0 D12

Problem:	The descriptions of  lbsplit  lwsplit  bljoin  and  wljoin ,
		if taken literally, would be inaccurate.
		 

Proposal:   1275.0 D12 Page 131 line 12, change to:
		"Bits 8 and above of the four input parameters must be zero."
	    1275.0 D12 Page 208 line 3, change to:
		"Bits 16 and above of the two input parameters must be zero."
	    1275.0 D12 Page 168 line 33, change to:
		"Bits 8 and above of the four resulting values will be zero."
	    1275.0 D12 Page 171 line 29, change to:
		"Bits 16 and above of the four resulting values will be zero."


Discussion:  I would have liked to say "are ignored" in the xxJoin words,
		 instead of "must be zero", but, in fact, many existing
		 implementations do not ignore these bits..,
