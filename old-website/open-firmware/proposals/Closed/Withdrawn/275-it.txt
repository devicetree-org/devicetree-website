P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #275 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          new PowerPC processor binding properties -- "64b-addr" and 
                "64b-exec"

Author:         John A. Kingman

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       add new properties ("64b-addr", "64b-exec") to CPU nodes

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor Binding 1.02 

Problem:        Current binding does not identify processors with 64-bit 
                capabilities and operating systems should not have to rely
                on specific model numbers to determine this.

Proposal:       

Add the following words to the section: "CPU node properties"

"64b-addr"
    This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC processor (defined 
    by this CPU node) has standard PowerPC 64-bit addressing capability in 
    addition to standard PowerPC 32-bit addressing capability.  The absence 
    of this property indicates that the PowerPC processor (defined by this 
    CPU node) has only the standard PowerPC 32-bit addressing capability.

"64b-exec"
    This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC processor (defined 
    by this CPU node) has standard PowerPC 64-bit instruction execution 
    capability in addition to the standard PowerPC 32-bit instruction execution 
    capability.  The absence of this property indicates that the PowerPC 
    processor (defined by this CPU node) has only the standard PowerPC 32-bit 
    instruction execution capability.
