Subject: Item #214: P 214 V 1 - Clarify substitution of FCode tokens for  rl@  and  rl! 


		P1275 Openboot Proposal			Proposal #: 214 Ver 1

		1275.0 Errata Proposal

Title:		Clarify substitution of FCode tokens for  rl@  and  rl! 

Author:		David L. Paktor

Date:		Tue 29 Nov 94

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:       The notes for RL@ and RL! in the glossary are not entirely
		    clear as to when the substitution of the FCode token
		    should occur.

Doc Version:	P1275.0 D12

Problem:        The notes for RL@ and RL! in the glossary do not quite make
		    clear when the substitution of the FCode token should
		    occur.  An experienced Open Firmware implementer might
		    be able to infer the correct answer, but, I believe, a
		    newcomer would be left quite baffled.  A sentence or two
		    of clarifying text would be helpful to both.


Proposal:	Add the following sentences after Page 191 line 44 and after
		    Page 192 line 15:

		"The substitution of the FCode tokens for  rl@  and  rl!
		    shall take place immediately before the interpretation
		    of the FCode of a child-device, as by  probe-self .
		    Upon completion of interpretation of the child-device's
		    FCode, the FCode tokens for  rl@  and rl!  shall be
		    restored to their previous values."
