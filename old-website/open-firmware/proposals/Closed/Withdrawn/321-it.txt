P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:321 Ver 1

Title:          Interrupt Mapping Recommended Practice

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           2/29/96

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       new Recommended Practice for Interrupt Mapping

Doc & Version:  Interrupt Mapping 0.5

Problem:        The bus bindings all have their own definition of the 
"interrupts" property and platforms can implement aribitrary routing of
interupt lines such that client programs can not determine where an
interrupt is actually presented.

Proposal:       

This proposal was discussed at previous meetings.  This is the actual
proposal to back up those discussions.  Since I already have the proposal
formatted in Frame, I am attaching a uuencoded version of the Acrobat(tm)
PDF file.  I will have hard copies available at the meeting.


Ron
