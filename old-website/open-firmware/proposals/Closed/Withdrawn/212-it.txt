Subject: Item #212: P 212 V 1 - Core Document errata: "xxJoin"



		P1275 Openboot Proposal			Proposal #: 212 Ver 1

		1275.0 Errata Proposal

(This is a re-send to get an official proposal number.  The text is unchanged.)


Title:		"xxJoin"

Author:		David L. Paktor

Date:		Mon 28 Nov 94

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	Improve phrasing in Core descriptions of  bljoin  and  wljoin

Doc Version:	1275.0 D12

Problem:	The descriptions of  bljoin  and  wljoin , if taken literally,
		would be inaccurate.
		 

Proposal:   1275.0 D12 Page 131 line 12, change to:
		"Bits 8 and above of the four input parameters must be zero."
	    1275.0 D12 Page 208 line 3, change to:
		"Bits 16 and above of the two input parameters must be zero."


Discussion:  I would have liked this to read "are ignored" instead of
		 "must be zero", but, in fact, existing implementations
		 do not ignore these bits.


David
