P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:341 Ver 1

Title:          Device Support Extensions: Clarify Scope

Author:         David Kahn

Date:           Mon Apr 22 20:52:20 PDT 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       The scope of the Device Support Extensions is incorrect.

Doc & Version:  Device Support Extensions Supplement (All versions).

Problem:        This document is a recommended practice that was
		originally authorized by the PReP binding committee
		and referred to and required by the PReP platform
		binding.  The scope of the document is vague and
		specifies that the document applies to everybody.
		It can't ... that immediately breaks all existing
		SPARC implementations.
		

Proposal:       
		Direct the editor to do the following:

		Make the DSE RP scope clear, that it's a suggested
		recommended practice and may be required by
		other RP or binding documents, but is not a core
		requirement.
