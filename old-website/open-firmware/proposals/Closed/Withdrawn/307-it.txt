Hi Jordan,

Here's a note from John O'Quin which outlines his concerns about the way
these variables are defined and used.  John's references are to the PowerPC
processor binding Version 1.7 which I passed out at the meeting.

If you could help me come up with some verbiage to clarify or replace 
what's there, I'd appreciate it.  

Thanks,

John Kingman

Subject: Item #307: PowerPC Processor Binding Comments/Concerns

PowerPC processor binding to: IEEE Std 1275-1994 Standard for Boot
(Initialization, Configuration) Firmware: Revision 1.7 dated January
11, 1996

I have the following comments/concerns about the above identified Open
Firmware binding:


1) Page 9 lines 25-27: This is wrong. It also conflicts with page 16
lines 10-12. It should say something like OF may choose its base
location if real-base is -1 and real-mode? is true or virt-base is -1
and real-mode? is false.

2) Page 9 lines 20-27: Please indicate what happens if real-size or
virt-size are -1. I expect to set real-mode? to true and real-base to
an address, but want to be able to set real-size to -1. Is this ok?

3) Page 9 lines 20-27, or page 21 lines 19-25: Need to indicate the
relationship between real-base/virt-base and load-base. I recommend
that we say that load-base is ignored if it conflicts with
real-base/virt-base. Note that real-base/virt-base can be specified in
the ELF header, but load-base can not so this conflict is very likely
and OSes can not prevent.

4) Page 13, lines 6-23: Need to add max_number_cpus property that
defines the maximum number of processors that this platform is designed
for. This would indicate the difference between a uniprocessor platform
and an SMP enabled platform with one processor.

5) Page 13, lines 6-23: Need optional slot-names property for external
labeling. See the PCI binding. The bit mask should be based on cpu reg
value. (Ron had indicated adding another field to the cpu name property
for this.)
