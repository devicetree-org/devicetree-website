Subject: Item #315: PPC binding update from CHRP

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #315 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          PowerPC processor binding update

Author:         John A. Kingman

Date:           February 21, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Incorporate updates resulting from various reviews

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor Binding 1.9 DRAFT

Problem:        Current binding needs to be updated to reflect additional
                editorial and structural changes resulting from additional
                reviews relating to the PowerPC Common Hardware Reference 
                Platform (CHRP).

Proposal:

                Key:  E -- editorial change
                      P -- move to platform (PReP/CHRP) binding
                      C -- resulting from CHRP review
                      S -- clarification

K Pg Lines Description of change
- -- ----- ---------------------------------------------------------------

S 10    3  Replace "either the real-base or virt-base values equal to -1"
           with "real-base equal to -1 and real-mode? true, or virt-base
           equal to -1 and real-mode? false"
           
        8  Add "If real-mode? is true, real-base is an address and 
           real-size equals -1, then Open Firmware may assume that there
           is sufficient real memory to continue. Likewise, if real-mode? 
           is false, virt-base is an address and virt-size equals -1, then 
           Open Firmware may assume that there is sufficient virtual memory 
           to continue."

C 11 24-27 Replace paragraph with the following:

           "Physical memory shall remain managed by Open Firmware until the
            client program defines the real-mode physical memory management
            assist callbacks.  The client program shall use the Open Firmware
            claim client interface service to allocate physical memory while
            physical memory remains managed by Open Firmware.  The client
            program shall not call the open, boot, enter or interpret Open
            Firmware client interface services while physical memory remains
            managed by Open Firmware.  Physical memory shall be managed by
            the client program after the client program defines the real-mode
            physical memory management assist callbacks.  Open Firmware shall
            use the client program's real-mode physical memory management
            assist callbacks to allocate physical memory after the client
            program has assumed physical memory management."

E 13 27-29 Change "unit-number" to "unit-address"

C 16    2  Add the following properties:

           "tlb-split"

              This property, if present, indicates that the TLB has a 
              split organization. Absence of this property indicates 
              that the TLB has a unified organization.

           "d-tlb-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the total number of d-TLB entries.

           "d-tlb-sets"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the number of associativity sets of the d-TLB. 
              A value of 1 indicates that the d-TLB is fully-associative.

           "i-tlb-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the total number of i-TLB entries.

           "i-tlb-sets"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the number of associativity sets of the i-TLB. 
              A value of 1 indicates that the i-TLB is fully-associative.

C 16   39  Add the following properties and note:

           "i-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the internal instruction cache's line size, 
              in bytes, if different than its block size.

           "d-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the internal data cache's line size, 
              in bytes, if different than its block size.

           Note: If this is a unified cache, the corresponding i- and
           d- sizes must be equal.

C 17   39  Add the following properties and note:

           "i-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents this instruction cache's line size, 
              in bytes, if different than its block size.

           "d-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents this data cache's line size, in bytes, if 
              different than its block size.

           Note: If this is a unified cache, the corresponding i- and
           d- sizes must be equal.

C 18   32  Add the following to Table 1:

           |--------------|---------------------------------------|------|
           |%sr0-%sr15    | preserved by client interface         |      |
           |--------------|---------------------------------------|------|

P 19  8-15 Copy to the platform bindings and replace the 3rd and 4th sentences
           with the following:

           "All of physical memory from load-base to either the start of
            Open Firmware physical memory or the end of physical memory,
            whichever comes first, shall be available for loading the 
            client program."

C 20   43  Add the following sentences:

           "All caches shall be consistent with memory and with each other
            when control is passed to the client program.  Also, consistency
            shall be maintained whenever control is temporarily passed back 
            to Open Firmware by the client."

S 22   30  Add the following sentences:

          "%sr0 through %sr15

               Access saved copies of segment registers."

S 22 52-54 Move to follow line 12
