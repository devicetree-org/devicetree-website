Subject: Item #269: Core recommended practice: test-method client interface

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #269 Ver 1

Title:		'test-method' client interface

Author:		David Kahn

Date:		19 May 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Create 'test-method' client interface

Doc & Version:	Core Doc, Recomended Practice.

Scope:		Recomended practice to all implementations of the client
		interface.

Problem:	Though there is a 'test' client interface, there is
		no 'test-method' client interface, to determine if
		a given method-name in a given package exists.

Proposal:	

Create a recomended practice, creating the following client interface:

test-method

IN:	phandle, method-cstr
OUT:	exists-flag?

test-method	( method-cstr phandle -- exists-flag? )

In the package given by the argument *phandle* test for the existance
of the method given by *method-cstr* (as with find-method) and return
the value TRUE is the method exists, or FALSE if the method does not
exist, in the return argument, *exists-flag?*

NOTE: It is recomended that client programs test for existance of
the TEST-METHOD client interface prior to using it.

See Also: find-method.
