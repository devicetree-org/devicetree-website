P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:409 Ver 1

Title:          Set-Resolution method for graphics drivers

Author:         David L. Paktor

Date:           Tue 27 May 97

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Synchronize system console with Client-generated mode changes

Doc & Version:  8-bit Graphics Extension

Problem:	If a Client program takes control of a graphics device used
		as the system console and changes its display resolution, and
		the user drops back to the user-interface, (or the device in
		question reverts to its console function for whatever other
		reason), then the console character display would be rendered
		unreadable.

Proposal:	Recommend that graphics device drivers publish the following
		method:

	set-resolution ( width height -- )

		Cause Open Firmware to update those internal variables that are
		involved in character rendering, and the  width , height  and
		 linebytes  properties of the device, to accommodate the given
		values.  This serves as a means by which a Client can maintain
		synchronization between Open Firmware's use of the device and
		any changes the Client makes in the device's display resolution.


Discussion:	This recommendation is equally applicable to 8-bit or 1-bit
		(or N-bit) graphics devices, as long as they permit changing
		resolution and can be used as the system console; it is not
		clear to me whether it properly belongs in the 8-bit Graphics
		Extension document, or elsewhere.  Perhaps it should stand
		by itself?
