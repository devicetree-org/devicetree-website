P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #247 Ver 2

Title:          "name" properties for SCSI devices.

Author:         Mike Segapeli

Date:           3 Mar 95

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Add more descriptive "name" property values to SCSI devices.

Doc & Version:  IEEE Std 1275-1994

Problem:        Note: This proposal replaces Item #235 which was targeting
                      the PowerPC binding.

                Currently, the standard does not specify any rules for the
                "name" property for devices on the SCSI bus.  The PowerPC 
                binding (probably inappropriately) does specify two allowable
                strings: "disk" or "tape".  These are not very descriptive of 
                the variety of devices that could be attached.

Proposal:       Create an appendix which specifies the following:

                The name property for a device attached to a SCSI bus shall 
                be given a value based upon its SCSI device type.  The 
                following table shows the appropriate name property for
                each SCSI Device type:

                Dev
                Type Description              Name Property
                ---  -------------------      ------------
                00h  Direct-access device      harddisk

    Note: "harddisk" would be used to differentiate with "disk" 
          which is most likely being used very freely in existing 
          implementations, e.g. for most cdrom drives. Another
          possibility could be "dasd".

                01h  Sequential-access device  tape
                     (eg magnetic tape)
                02h  Printer device            printer

                04h  Write-once device         worm
                     (eg some optical disks)
                05h  CD-ROM device             cdrom
                06h  Scanner device            scanner
                07h  Optical memory device     optical
                     (eg some optical disks)
                08h  Medium changer device     changer
                     (eg jukeboxes)
                09h  Communications device     comm

                      devices)
                For all others                 scsi_## (##= Device type)
