		Section 6.3.5 on Page 22.

	to:

	Changed text for "prop-encoded-array" from 'A list of strings,

Page 16, lines 50-53: Added text, second paragraph, to define the 
	"prop-encoded-array" data structure.

Page 16: Deleted two properties, "interrupt-choices" and "dma-choices".
	Data structure in PnP Format with the 'dependent' resource was
	incorrect for the properties as they were defined.

Page 17, lines  3- 7: Removed author's note and did a format change.

Page 17, line 11: Format change.

Page 17, lines 20-22: Changed text for "prop-encoded-array" from 'a list of

	string in the list is encoded as with encode-string.  Format of
	the data resource is tbd' to 'an array of bytes containing PnP
	Packages encoded as with byte. Format of the data resource
	structure is defined to be PnP Data Resource (Section 6. on
	page 18).  The adapter data format would be defined in an 
	adapter binding'.

Page 17, line 29 & 31: Format changes.

Page 17, line 40: Changed text from 'Firmware expansion ROM' to 'Firmware
	expansion ROM ISA and EISA Adapters'.
