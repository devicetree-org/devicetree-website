Subject: Item #265: "regs" property for cpu nodes on PowerPC

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #265 Ver 1.0

Title:		"regs" property for CPU nodes

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 27, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	"regs" property for CPU nodes for MP machines

Doc & Version:	PowerPC processor binding to IEEE 1275 Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	There is no way to differentiate CPU nodes

Proposal:	Create a "regs" property for CPU nodes.  At the moment
		I would propose a prop encoded int which is a small
		integer starting at 0 and running up to n-1 (where n is
		the number of processors installed in the platform).

		It is possible that other information might want to be
		encoded in the "regs" property, but I'll leave that
		for discussion.
