Subject: Item #224: PowerPC - multiple instances of identical devices

(I don't remember whether we voted to do this.  Lest it get lost,
here it is again.)

P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:224 Ver 1.0

Title:          Correct text regarding multiple instances of identical devs

Author:         Jordan Brown

Date:           26 January 1995

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       "foo1" and "foo2" is wrong.  "foo@1" and "foo@2" is right.

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor binding 10/06/94

Problem:

Open Firmware philosophy says that the name of a device is the same
for all instances of identical devices; identical devices are
distinguished by differing unit numbers.  (That is, two identical
devices "foo" might be "foo@1" and "foo@2", not "foo1" and "foo2".)

PowerPC binding section 12.8, page 27 at 52, violates this,
requiring (eg) the second SCSI disk to be named "disk2".

Proposal:       

Therefore, proposed that in section 12.8, page 27 at 52, the paragraph
starting "If there are multiple instances of the same device type..."
be deleted.
