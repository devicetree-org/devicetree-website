Subject: Item #258: PowerPC timebase-frequency on 601 is unclear

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #258 Ver 1.0

Title:		cpu "timebase-frequency" on 601 is not well defined

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 21, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	601 processors to not have a timebase-frequency

Doc & Version:	PowerPC processor binding to OpenFirmware Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	601s do not support a timebase counter, but a real=time clock

Proposal:	Specifiy that for 601 PowerPC processors that one of the
		following be chosen:

		1) The timebase-frequency property of the cpu is meaningless
		2) The timebase-frequency property of the cpu shall be absent
		3) The timebase-frequency property of the cpu shall be -1
		4) The timebase-frequency property of the cpu shall be 1 billion

		[ed. the last two suggest by -1 being an indication of "not
		     supported and the 1 billion as that is the frequency
		     of the real-time clock]
