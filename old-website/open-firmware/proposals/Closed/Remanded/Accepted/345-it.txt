Subject: Item #345: CS4231 Device Binding


P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:345 Ver 0.2

Title:          Crystal Semiconductor Device Binding

Author:         Jordan Brown

Date:           22 April 1996

Ed/Tech:        Editorial, Technical

Synopsis:       Recast into device binding template.  Apply changes from 01/96.

Doc & Version:  CS423x Device Support Extension (renamed)

Problem:

Recast into device binding template.  Apply changes from 01/96 meeting.
Add a few hopefully non-controversial things (name, compatible, device_type).

Proposal:

[[ Again, this may not be the right process.  C'est la vie.  The intent
is to get this into a form suitable for publication as a draft. ]]

Crystal Semiconductor CS423x
Device Binding to

IEEE 1275-1994
Standard for Boot (Initialization,
Configuration) Firmware

1.	Purpose of this Device Binding

This document specifies the application of Open Firmware to the Crystal
Semiconductor CS423x audio controller family, including device-specific
requirements and practices for initialization, properties, and
methods.

4.	Definition of Terms

5.	Device Characteristics (Informative)

The Crystal Semiconductor CS423x family is a family of multipurpose
audio controllers.  They implements two general-purpose external
control lines which are often used to control external source and
destination switching, external amplifiers, and logic lines like
interrupts and DMA control.

6.	Device-specific Configuration Variables

	None.

7.	Device Nodes

7.1.	Properties

7.1.1.	Open Firmware-defined Properties for Device Nodes

As defined in [2] and [1], with the following specifics:

"name"
	If the Generic Names Recommended Practice is implemented by
	this package, this property shall have the value "sound".

	If the Generic Names Recommended Practice is not implemented
	by this package, this property shall have the value "cs423x",
	where "x" is as appropriate for the device.

"compatible"
	
	If the Generic Names Recommended Practice is implemented
	by this package, the first entry in this property shall have
	the value "cs423x", where "x" is as appropriate for the device.

"device_type"
	The value of this property shall be "sound".

7.1.2.	Device-specific Properties for Device Nodes

"xctl0"
	Standard property, encoded with encode-string, that describes
	the function that occurs when external control line 0 (indirect
	register 10, bit 6) is set to 1.  Valid values for this property
	shall be one of "enable internal speaker", "mute internal speaker",
	"enable headphone", "mute headphone", "enable lineout", "mute
	lineout", "enable interrupt", "disable interrupt", "enable dma",
	"disable dma", or "not connected".

"xctl1"
	Standard property, encoded with encode-string, that describes
	the function that occurs when external control line 0 (indirect
	register 10, bit 6) is set to 1.  Valid values for this property
	are as for "xctl0".
	
7.2.	Methods

7.2.1.	Open Firmware-defined Methods for Device Nodes

	As defined in [2], without addition or modification.

7.2.1.1.	Device Arguments for "Open" Method

	None.

7.2.2.	Device-specific Methods for Device Nodes

	None.

8.	User Interface Commands

8.1.	Open Firmware-defined User Interface Commands

	None.

8.2.	Device-specific User Interface Commands

	None.

9.	Device State

9.1.	Device State When Client is Started

	Unspecified.

9.2.	Device State Required When Client Calls Open Firmware

	Unspecified.

9.3.    Device State When Open Firmware Returns Control to Client

	Unspecified.

10.	Other Commentary

	Note:  This binding needs additional work.  In particular, it needs
	definitions of "reg" and "interrupt", and discussions of device
	state.
