1.	Purpose of this Device Binding

This document specifies the application of Open Firmware to standard PC
serial port devices, including device-specific requirements and
practices for initialization, properties, and methods.

2.	Revision History

	Revision 0.1, 08 January 1996
		Initial revision.

3.	References

[1]	IEEE Std 1275-1994 Standard for Boot (Initialization, Configuration)
	Firmware, Core Practices and Requirements
[2]	<Intel doc for 8450>
[3]	<NS doc for 16550>

4.	Definition of Terms

5.	Device Characteristics (Informative)

	The PC serial port is one of the most standardized pieces of
	hardware in the industry, mostly due to the relative lack of
	support for it in older operating systems and so the tendency
	for applications programs to directly manipulate it.

	The original PC serial ports were implemented using the Intel
	8450 [2], a simple UART that supplied only a single byte of
	buffering in each direction.  More modern implementations are
	based on the National Semiconductor 16550 [3], a superset that
	supplies a 16-byte FIFO in each direction.

6.	Device-specific Configuration Variables

	None.

7.	Device Nodes

7.1.	Properties

7.1.1.	Open Firmware-defined Properties for Device Nodes

name
	prop-name, specifies the generic name of the device.
	prop-encoded array:  a string encoded with encode-string.

	The meaning of this property is as defined in Open Firmware,
	as modified by the Generic Names Recommended Practice.
	The value for nodes described by this specification shall
	be "serial".

device_type
	prop-name, specifies the implemented interface.
	prop-encoded array:  a string encoded with encode-string.

	The meaning of this property is as defined in Open Firmware.
	The value for nodes described by this specification shall
	be "serial".

compatible
	prop-name, specifies device names with which this device is
	compatible.
	prop-encoded-array:  an array of strings, each encoded with
	encode-string.
	
	The meaning of this property is as defined in Open Firmware, as
	modified by the Generic Names Recommended Practice.  As
	described in those documents, the entries are a list of device
	names with which this device is compatible, starting with the
	name of the device itself and progressing through successively
	less precise and possibly less functional compatible devices.

	For the National Semiconductor 16450 and 16550, the names shall
	be "ns16450" and "ns16550" respectively.  For the Intel
	8450, the name shall be "i8450".

	Note:  A device compatible with the NS 16550 is also compatible
	with the NS 16450 and the Intel 8450, and so should list all
	three.  For example, the National Semiconductor PC87312 is
	a composite chip containing, among other things, two NS 16550
	compatible serial interfaces.  Its "compatible" property
	might well start "ns-pc87312-serial" and should include
	"ns16550", "ns16450", and "i8450" in that order.

	Additional entries may be supplied, at their appropriate
	position in the list, to describe devices with which this
	device is compatible.

reg
	[boilerplate]

	A single entry describing the device's register set.

interrupts
	[boilerplate]

	A single entry describing the device's interrupts.

7.1.2.	Device-specific Properties for Device Nodes

out1
out2
	[boilerplate]

	These properties specify what the OUT1 and OUT2 (respectively)
	pins on the device are attached to.  The allowed values are:
	
	"enable interrupt"
	    This pin gates the interrupt line.
	    
	    Note:  PC-AT compatible implementations use OUT2 for this
	    purpose.
	
	"" (null string)
	    This value indicates that the pin is not connected.

	Note:  For historical reasons, it is probably appropriate
	to assume "enable interrupt" for "out2" and "no connection"
	for "out1" if these properties are absent.

clock-frequency
	[boilerplate]

	This property specifies the clock frequency supplied to the
	baud rate generator, in megahertz.

	Note:  PC compatible implementations use a clock frequency of
	1.8432 MHz, and so on those implementations this value should
	be 1843200.

7.2.	Methods

7.2.1.	Open Firmware-defined Methods for Device Nodes

	As specified in [1], without addition or modification.

7.2.1.1.	Device Arguments for "Open" Method

	As specified in [1], without addition or modification.

7.2.2.	Device-specific Methods for Device Nodes

	None.

8.	User Interface Commands

8.1.	Open Firmware-defined User Interface Commands

	None.

8.2.	Device-specific User Interface Commands

	None.

9.	Device State

9.1.	Device State When Client is Started

	[ Note:  this should be specified in the generic definition
	of serial devices. ]

	For devices not selected as Open Firmware's "standard input" or
	"standard output", the initial state is undefined.

	For devices which are selected as Open Firmware's "standard input"
	or "standard output", the device shall be initialized appropriately
	for the device to which it is attached.

9.2.	Device State Required When Client Calls Open Firmware

	For devices not selected as Open Firmware's "input-device" or
	"output-device", there is no requirement.

	For devices selected as Open Firmware's "input-device" or
	"output-device", the client should not modify the device state.

	Note:  If the device is in a different state when the client
	calls Open Firmware, unpredictable behavior may result if Open
	Firmware accepts input or generates output.  Clients changing
	the device state should either restore the original state
	before calling Open Firmware or should avoid using Open
	Firmware features requiring user interaction.  Changing the
	device state is likely to render Open Firmware unusable for
	debugging purposes.

9.3.    Device State When Open Firmware Returns Control to Client

	Open Firmware must return the device to the client with its
	state unmodified.
