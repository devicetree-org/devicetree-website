Synopsis:       Add mandatory support of the halt string "suspend"

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor binding -- dated: 941006

Problem:        Need mechanisms for creating and restoring the ram image
                in support of hardware suspend function.

Proposal:

The firmware shall support halt string "suspend" in the following manner.

Function:
 1. The firmware shall preserve the ram image exclusive of that devoted to
firmware use (see System State at call below).
 2. If the firmware encounters an error or the hardware does not
support suspend the halt procedure shall set the appropriate return code
(see System State at return below) and return to the caller.
 3. The firmware shall record suspend restoration parameters in the
system's configuration memory.
 4. The firmware shall set the system power state to suspend in a system
dependent manner (this usually means powering down everything except the
memory sub-system and its refresh).
 5. When the system is subsequently powered up, the firmware reads the
suspend restoration parameters and:
 6. Initializes the system hardware as on IPL without disturbing the ram
image preserved above.
 7. Does not load the standard client program (so as not to disturb the
preserved ram image.
 8. Resets the suspend restoration parameters in configuration memory.
 9. Returns to the caller of suspend (see System State at Return below).

System State at call:
 Memory:
        The memory range defined by the "real-base" and "real-size"
        configuration variable is undefined but available for use by open
        firmware.
 Master processor:
        As specified for other halt call-back functions.
        |%r3 | -halt argument-> | 1st pointer | --> suspend[0]
 Slave Processors:
        In an SMP system only one processor shall call the Halt procedure
        with a halt string of "suspend" all other processors shall call
        the halt procedure with the halt string "slave".  The Halt
        procedure may cause the slave processors to loop in a program that
        does not change the state of memory.
        |%r3 | -halt argument-> | 1st pointer | --> slave[0]
 IO Sub-system:
        All elements of the IO sub-system shall be in a safe state.  In a
        safe state, they shall not be transferring data to or from memory
        nor shall they cause an interrupt to any processor.
 Interrupt Sub-system:
        The processor's MSR EE=0 prior to calling the Halt procedure.

System State at return:
 Memory:
        The state of the memory locations, exclusive of the range defined
        by the "real-base" and "real-size" configuration variables, shall
        be preserved in the state they were in at the call to the Halt
        procedure.
 Master Processor:
        The state of the master processor shall be as defined for the
        "initial program state" with the following exceptions.  The
        processor will start executing at the address which was in the
        master processor's link register when the Halt procedure was
        called. %r3 shall contain the return code see below.
 Slave Processors:
        The state of the slave processors upon restoration from suspension
        shall as follows: The MSR as defined for "initial program state".
        All non-architected processor dependent registers shall be set to
        the system dependent default value. All other architected registers
        are undefined. The processor shall start executing at the address
        which was in the slave processor's link register when the Halt
        procedure was called. %r3 shall contain the return code 0.
 IO Sub-system:
        All elements of the IO sub-system shall be initialized to a safe
        state.  The device tree shall be re-established as on IPL.
 Interrupt Sub-system:
        The processor's MSR EE=0.
 Return Codes:
        0 -> Restored from suspend
        -1 -> Hardware does not support suspend power state
