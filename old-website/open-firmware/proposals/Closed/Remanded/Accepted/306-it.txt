P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #306 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          PowerPC processor binding update

Author:         John A. Kingman

Date:           January 17, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Incorporate updates resulting from various reviews

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor Binding 1.6 DRAFT

Problem:        Current binding needs to be updated to reflect support for
                64-bit and other optional implementations as well as other
                editorial and structural changes resulting from reviews
                relating to the Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP).

Proposal:

                Key:  E -- editorial change
                      P -- move to platform (PReP/CHRP) binding
                      C -- resulting from CHRP review
                      6 -- 64/32 bit support
                      S -- clarification

           BAT area defined is 128 KB (2^17 bytes).  The largest BAT area
           defined is 256 MB (2^28 bytes).  The starting address of a BAT

           "cpu-state"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-string, that
              represents the processor state.

              The values of this property are either "running", "idle",
              or "stopped."

           "bus-frequency"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
              represents the speed (in hertz) of this processor's bus.

           "32-64-bridge"

              prop-encoded-array: <none>

              This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node implements
              the "Bridge Facilities and Instructions for 64-bit
              Implementations" as described in an appendix of Book III
              of [2]. The absence of this property indicates that the
              PowerPC microprocessor defined by this CPU node does not
              support these facilities and instructions.

           "emulation-assist-unit"

              prop-encoded-array: <none>

              This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node implements the
              emulation assist unit (EAU). The absence of this property
              indicates that the PowerPC microprocessor defined by this
              CPU node does not implement the EAU.

           "external-control"

              prop-encoded-array: <none>

              This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node implements the
              External Control Facility as described in the "Optional
              Facilitites and Instructions" appendix of Book II of [2].
              The absence of his property indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node does not support
              the External Control Facility.

           "general-purpose"

              prop-encoded-array: <none>

              This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node implements the
              floating point instructions fsqrt and fsqrts.  The absence
              of this property indicates that the PowerPC microprocessor
              defined by this CPU node does not support the floating
              point instructions fsqrt and fsqrts.

           "reservation-granule-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
              represents the reservation granule size (i.e., the minimum
              size of lock variables) supported by this processor, in bytes.

           "graphics"

              prop-encoded-array: <none>

              This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node implements the
              floating point instructions stfiwx, fres, frsqrte, and fsel.
              The absence of this property indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node does not support the
              floating point instructions stfiwx, fres, frsqrte, and fsel.

           "performance-monitor"

              prop-encoded-array: <none>

              This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node implements the
              performance monitor functionality.  The absence of this
              property indicates that the PowerPC microprocessor defined
              by this CPU node does not support this performance monitor
              functionality.

           "tlbia"

              prop-encoded-array: <none>

              This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC
              microprocessor defined by this CPU node implements the
              tlbia insruction.  The absence of this property indicates
              that the PowerPC microprocessor defined by this CPU node
              does not support the tlbia insruction.
