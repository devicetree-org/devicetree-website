P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #253 Ver 1.0

Title:		PowerPC use of memory clarifications

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 21, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Use of memory is unclear

Doc & Version:	PowerPC binding to OpenFirmware Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	The use of memory especially by "claim" is unclear

Proposal:	In section 1.4 (page 4) add text similar to the following:

		The first 5 (this number may need adjustment) physical pages
		shall *never* be claimed by OpenFirmware and shall be
		reflected in the "available" property of the "memory" node.
		...
		When a "claim" service or method is requested by a client,
		the memory (virtual and/or physical as appropriate) shall
		be from the range outside of that specified by "virt-base"
		through "virt-base" + "virt-size" and/or "real-base" through
		"real-base" + "real-size" as appropriate.  The memory
		specified from within the OpenFirmware limits shall be used
		by OpenFirmware for internal use only, never on behalf of
		the client.
		
		[ed. wordsmithing gratefully accepted]
