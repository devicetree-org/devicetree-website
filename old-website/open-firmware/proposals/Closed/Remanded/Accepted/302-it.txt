Subject: Item #302: PReP floppy and ide device types are inappropriate

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #302 Ver 1.0

Title:		Standard ISA mass storage device controllers

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		Dec 12, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	ide and floppy device types are inappropriate

Doc & Version:	PowerPC Reference Platform Binding revision 0.02

Problem:	ide and floppy controllers are *not* block devices

Proposal:	
		On page 8 section 6.3 lines 25 & 28 which read

		floppy		"block"

		and

		ide		"block"

		change to

		floppy		"floppy"
		    disk	"block"
		    tape	"byte"

		and

		ide		"ide"
		   disk		"block"
		   cdrom	"block"


		Further there needs to be bindings for floppy and ide, but
		I'll put that in another proposal.

		Also on page 9 there is the requirement for the
		alias "floppy", but it unclear whether that should
		be the controller (like scsi) or whether is should be
		the default floppy diskette (like disk).  This needs
		to be made clear.  I propose that it be the controller
		and the common use would be "floppy/disk@0".
