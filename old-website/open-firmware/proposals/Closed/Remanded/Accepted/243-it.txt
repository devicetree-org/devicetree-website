Subject: Item #243: PowerPC binding - reboot command section?

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #243 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          Reboot-command section???

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           March 2, 1995

Ed/Tech:        Editorial?

Synopsis:       missing section

Doc & Version:  PowerPC Binding, 2/16/95

Problem:        The section that describes the "reboot-command" seems
                                to have been deleted in the latest revision.

Proposal:

On page 20, there is a description of the "reboot-command-address"
Configuration Variable that references section 4.1...  But, section 4.1 no
longer describes the reboot-command mechanism.  What happened???
