253:     example physical memory on powerpc systems used for interrupt
253:     vectors, shall not appear in the "available" property of the 
253:     memory node.  Client Programs that need to use such memory for
253:     its architected purpose must not claim that area prior to use".
253:     Delete second paragraph.
254: Subject: Item #254: PPC Binding: memory granularity
254: Closed: Accepted unanimously as ammended.

255: Subject: Item #255: PPC Binding: Virtual mode rules should be revised 
255: Accepted: Ammended as follows (June 7' 95):
255:  When a client executes set-callback, Open Firmware shall attempt to
255:  invoke the "translate" callback. If the translate callback  is
255:  implemented, Open Firmware shall cease use of address translation
255:  hardware, instead using the client callbacks for changes to address
255:  translation.
255: 
255:  The exit service must continue to work after a set-callback that takes
255:  over address translation. This implies that Open Firmware takes
255:  responsibililty for address translation hardware upon exit and must
255:  maintain internal information about translations that it requests of
255:  the client.
255: 
255:  On page 6 of the PowerPC binding, strike line 29. On lines 34 and 35,
255:  replace ": <bullet> shall" with "that take control of the management of
255:  address translation hardware and expect to be able to subsequently
255:  invoke Open Firmware client services must [provide callbacks ...]"
255:  
255:  On page 9 of the PowerPC binding, change line 29 to read:
255:

258: Closed: Accepted unanimously as amended.
258: Add a note to section 5.2. The 601 PowerPC does not have a 
258: timebase frequency; i.e., the value reported in timebase-frequency 
258: property shall be 1 billion which represents the logical rate of 
258: the real time clock. 
259: Subject: Item #259: PPC Binding: client program formats ... too broadly

262:  Change language on p. 8 of PReP binding to "...devices attached

267: Accepted: June 7'95, Amended as follows:
267:  "system-id"
267:
267:  Standard property, encoded as with encode-string, that contains
267:  the identification of the computer system. This string shall be
267:  unique across all systems and all manufacturers. If the system-id
267:  begins with "0", it shall be of the form "0nnnnnnmmmmmm" where nnnnnn
267:  is a sequence of 6 uppercase hexadecimal digits representing a 24-bit
267:  Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE
267:  Registration Authority Committee, and mmmmmm is a sequence of 6
267:  uppercase hexadecimal digits representing a 24-bit binary number
267:  assigned by the manufacturer to assure uniqueness.
267: 
267:  Note: For systems with built-in ethernet or other IEEE 802-style
267:  interfaces, the 6-byte MAC address assigned to that interface meets the
267:  requirements and should be used as the system-id.

276: Ammend new bullet:
276:      A client program shall not directly manipulate any
276:      address translation hardware before it either a) ceases to
276:      invoke OF client services or b) issues a set-callback to
276:      install the "translate" callback.
276:
276:    Note:
276:     The intended sequence is that a client program will first issue a
276:    set-callbak and then take control of address translation hardware.
276:    Address translation hardware includes BAT registers, page table,
276:     Segment Registers, MSR and the Interrupt vectors relating to

317:0 Closed: Accepted with amendments
317:1 Amendments:
317:2   Page 10, line 3: Replace entire paragraph:
317:3     "If the client program has specific requirements for physical
317:4      memory or address space usage, it may establish requirements
317:5      for OF's physical and/or virtual address space usage by means
317:6      of its program header.  When OF loads the client program, it
317:7      inspects the program header, and if its current usage of
317:8      physical memory or virtual address space conflicts with that
317:9      specified in the program header, OF shall set the real-base,
317:0     real-size, virt-base, and virt-size to the configuration
317:1     variables as specified in the header and restart itself.
317:2     real-base, virt-base, real-size and virt-size may be specified
317:3     as -1, in which case the firmware is permitted to choose
317:4     appropriate values for the variables specified as -1."
317:5  Page 10, line 7: Replace paragraph beginning at line 7:
317:6    "If the values of the real-size and/or virt-size config vars do
317:7     not provide sufficient memory and/or virtual address space for
317:8     the firmware's own use, then the firmware shall not attempt to
317:9     load a client program and the condition should be reported to
317:0     the user.  The possibility of not being able to comply with
317:1     limitiations on firmware's size should be tested as the
317:2     firmware is coming up in order to handle the possibility that
317:3     a user established an unworkable limitation on the size."
317:4
317:5    Add "Clients can minimize this exposure by setting the size to
317:6     -1 and allowing Open Firmware to choose the size."
317:7  Page 11, lines 24-27: Client programs are not required to assume
317:8     responsibility for physical memory management. Put at beginning
317:9     of paragraph. State in both pos and neg context.
317:0  Page 18: split Table 1 into sections: real-mode and virt-mode;
317:1     change "preserved by client interface" to "client interface shall
317:2     preserve"; add definition for preserved - same value when returing;
317:3     indicate that the msr, segment registers & sprg registers shall
317:4     not be modified by the client interface in virtual mode; indicate
317:5     that the msr, segment registers & sprg registers shall be preserved
317:6     by the client interface in real mode; remove '%' signs in this
317:7     section.
317:8  Page 19, Table 2: Change "Others" to "Other user mode registers".
317:9  Page 19, lines 8-15: replace the 3rd and 4th sentences with the def.
317:0     of load-base.  Add the proposed sentence to the end of the paragraph.
317:1  Page 20, line 40: After the first sentence add:
317:2     "The I cache shall be consistent with the D cache for all
317:3     memory areas occupied by the client program."
317:4  Page 20, after line 43: Add:
317:5      "All processors in a SMP system shall have the same
317:6      consistent view of all memory areas (for data references).
317:7      No more than one processor shall have a modified copy of
317:8      the same data area in its cache when the client program
317:9      is called.
317:0        Note: If firmware makes cachable M=0 data references from
317:1          different processors on a SMP system, it may have to
317:2          perform additional cache management to meet this
317:3          requirement."
317:4  Page 22, line 30: Segment Register's sentence, don't add.
317:5  Page 22, lines 52-54: Move lines to behind line 12.
