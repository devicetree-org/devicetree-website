<h1>About This Web Page</h1>

This Web Page describes Open Firmware at an introductory level.  This 
description will not substitute for a course given by Firmworks or Forth 
Inc on Open Firmware, but it will, I hope, give the reader a pretty good 
idea of how Open Firmware presents the industry with an elegant solution 
to some knotty problems of booting an operating system.<p>

<h1>Open Firmware - A New Class of Software Tool</h1>

Open Firmware provides a novel capability, virtually unheard of before its 
invention in 1988 at Sun.  This new capability is writing <STRONG>hardware 
independent</STRONG> boot code, firmware and device drivers.<P>

<H1>A Brief History of Open Firmware</H1>

As mentioned above, Open Firmware was invented at Sun for release in 1988 
to prevent a maintenance and support nightmare with the then unprecedented 
wide choice of hardware and software configurations the new product lines 
required.  Open Firmware, then called Open Boot, prevented the nightmare 
by allowing one version of the Boot Rom to run on any configuration of 
hardware and software, even supporting boot-time operations on third-party 
plug-in cards.<P>

The idea worked so well, other major players in the computer market, such 
as IBM and Apple, got in on the act as well.  The existence of a 
comprehensive IEEE standard for Open Firmware, IEEE-1275, makes this 
possible.<P>

<H1>Hardware Independent Boot Code? Get Real!</H1>

This is such a new capability, it defies belief.  Open Firmware provides 
this capability by a careful application of the FORTH philosophy.  Just as 
FORTH has always presented its users with unique capabilities through a 
careful combination of 1) pushdown stack 2) dictionary and 3) interpreter, 
so Open Firmware works because of its combination of 1) standardized 
tokens=<A HREF="#DefFC">FCode</A><A NAME="FC"></A>, 2) <a 
href="#DefUI">User Interface</a>~=<A NAME="UI"></A> outer interpreter 3) <a 
href="#DefDI">Device Interface </a>~= <a name="DI"></a>inner interpreter 
and 4) <A HREF="#DefCI">Client Interface</A><A NAME="CI"></A> to allow the 
OS to call Open Firmware services with the calling conventions and bindings 
of a high-level language, such as C.  We will see later in this web page how 
all these pieces fit together to form such an amazingly flexible whole.<P>

<H1>The Tasks of Boot Code</H1>

Before we can understand why the various pieces of OF fit together the way 
they do, we must understand for what purpose they do so.  This in turn 
requires that we understand the basic tasks of boot code on a wide class 
of systems.  These tasks are largely 1) Boot-time Drivers and 2) building 
a <EM>device tree</EM>, which the Operating System then uses to discover 
what devices are available to it and how to use them.  The particular 
format of the <a href="#DefDT">device tree</a><A NAME="DT"></A> is 
operating system dependent, but all device trees have a great deal in 
common.  That commonality can be expressed in a common language 
independent of the operating system.  The format of an Open Firmware 
device tree is such a common language.  In a typical installation, the 
operating system uses Client Interface calls to translate the Open 
Firmware device tree into the Operating system's own format.  In the rest 
of this web page, we will assume that  Open Firmware is being used for such 
a "typical installation", although there are cases when you might want to 
use only parts of Open Firmware, such as only a Device Interface, for 
"non-typical" applications.<P>

<H1>An Open Firmware Device Tree</H1>

The Open Firmware Device Tree is a generic and simple format for a device 
tree.  It can be used to represent the various entries in a device tree 
for just about any operating system.  Like any tree, it consists of nodes, 
some of which are leaf nodes, i.e. have no children.  Every node has one 
parent, except for the top node.  Each node has a node name, and a list of 
"<a href="#DefPR">properties</a>"<A NAME="Prop"></A> and"<a 
href="#DefME">methods</a>"<A NAME="Meth"></A>.  In fact, the node name 
<EM>is</EM> a property, one that is required for every node.  The 
properties are named data.  Open firmware makes no restrictions on how the 
operating system will eventually use this named data, except for reserving 
certain names to have certain meanings: the "name" property, for example, 
is always the node name.  This named data may also be of any type: string 
and integer types are specifically supported, while compound types may be 
grouped together out of combinations of "int" "string" and "bytes", the 
latter being for any length of arbitrary consecutive bytes.<P>

<H1>Open Firmware Boot Drivers</H1>

The Boot Drivers supplied by Open Firmware are mainly meant for supplying 
messages that must be displayed during boot time, before the operating 
system has been loaded.  They are also handy for other purposes, such as 
debugging hardware that is failing during boot time.  For such purposes, 
it is not important that this sort of driver knows nothing about the 
operating system (which typically hasn't even been loaded yet).  These 
drivers therefore do not work in the background, are not multi-taskable, 
nor do they use interrupts.  They provide the most basic operations on the 
device, such as open, close, read and write.  These operations are all 
implemented as Open Firmware methods, i.e., FORTH words accessible from 
the User Interface when the given device is selected.  We will cover this 
concept in more detail later.<P>

This is the Open Firmware component that most closely resembles a 
traditional FORTH system.  On the Apple PCI Macintoshes, you enter the 
Open Firmware User Interface by holding down the NMI switch while toggling 
the Reset Line.  Then the System Firmware, sensing these switches, goes 
through a truncated boot process; instead of loading the entire system, it 
starts with low-level hardware diagnostics, then loads Open Firmware, 
opens the modem port (i.e. Serial Port # 1) for I/O, prints a boot message 
and awaits your commands on that port, just like QUIT in a traditional 
FORTH system.  The method of entering the User Interface is not defined by 
the IEEE-1275 standard; it is implementation dependent.<P>

<H1>Dictionary Searching</H1>

Dictionary Searching is a little strange in Open Firmware.  There are no 
vocabularies in the FORTH79 or FORTH83 sense of the word.  Instead, Open 
Firmware supports a new and peculiar notion, the <A 
href="#DefAct">active-package.</A>  Furthermore, there are really two 
sorts of definitions possible under the User Interface: conventional FORTH 
words appended to the root "vocabulary", and Open Firmware methods 
appended to the active-package.  When the user types in a word, the User 
Interface looks up the word first in the list of methods of the <A 
NAME="ActP">active-package</A>, then in the root FORTH definitions not 
attached to any package.<P>

Clearly, the use of packages instead of the more usual sort of 
vocabularies takes some getting used to.  But this new sort of vocabulary 
is pretty well suited for the tasks of boot-time firmware.<p>

An even more marked difference from the traditional method of dictionary 
searching is the use of <STRONG>$call-method</STRONG> or its congeners 
<STRONG>$call-parent</STRONG> and <STRONG>call-package</STRONG> to call 
methods not in the current search order.  These words are used 
frequently.  We will describe the use of these words in more detail after 
covering the prerequisite notion of the <A HREF="#DefIC">instance 
chain</A><A NAME="IC"></A>.

<H1>Devices, Packages and THE Active Package</H1>

Unfortunately, the IEEE-1275 spec and the Open Firmware language itself 
uses the terms "device" and "package" inconsistently.  Sometimes, the two 
terms are used to mean the same thing, sometimes they are not!  In the 
spec's own words:
<P>

<blockquote>
	A package is the combination of a device node's properties, methods and 
	private data.  In most cases, the terms "package" and "device node" may 
	be used interchangeably. "Device node" is typically used when the 
	emphasis is on the node as a part of the device tree, and "package" is 
	used with emphasis on the use of the node's driver methods.</blockquote><P>
I would have been happier if they had said:<P>
<blockquote>
	A package is the combination of a device node's properties, methods and 
	private data (so far, so good). "Device nodes" and "packages" are 
	usually strongly linked, i.e, a device node has a package associated 
	with it, every package has an entry in the device tree, i.e., a device 
	node associated with it.  But there are pure software packages with no 
	physical device associated with them.  For all other packages, the 
	device node and the package are two different ways of looking at the 
	same thing.</blockquote><P>
	
A simple example should make the above ideas more clear: the IEEE-1275 
spec suggests (but does not require) that the default input device be 
named "keyboard".  In this case, there will be an entry in the device-tree 
(i.e. a device node) named "keyboard", which includes methods "open", 
"close" and "read".  The only property it MUST contain is the "name" 
property, "keyboard".  For the convenience of the users, the properties 
"model" (a string property naming the model number) and "compatible" (a 
string property naming a more popular model with which the keyboard is 
compatible) might also be included.  In Apple's case, it also defines the 
property "device_type", setting it equal to "serial".<P>

The collection of all these properties, methods and whatever private data 
the methods use is the package corresponding to the device "keyboard".<P>

Now many systems will also define a pure software package, called the 
"deblocker", whose purpose in life is to "deblock" a block-oriented 
device, i.e., provide <A HREF="#DefByteO">byte-oriented</A><A 
NAME="BO"></A> methods to access the <A 
HREF="#DefBlockO">block-oriented</A><A NAME="#BKO"></A> device.  This is 
analogous to the old FORTH trick of implementing virtual memory using 
BLOCK, which views the disk as a block-oriented device (hence the name).  
The deblocker has its own entry in the device-tree much like a true 
physical device, but there are a few significant differences: it must be a 
child of the node "/packages" in the device-tree, it has no address, and 
it can and should be opened with"open-package" instead of with 
"open-device".<P>

<h1>Blazing the Trail to Plug and Play</h1>
Open Firmware does not solve all the problems that need to be solved to 
make Plug & Play a reality in the DOS, Windows or Macintosh environments.  
However,it solves some of the major problems, and provides a framework for 
solving the others.  If manufacturers can agree on how to use the 
properties that might be defined for their devices, then this will go a 
long way to making plug and play a reality.  Open Firmware makes this much 
simpler than ever before.<P>

<H1>Why FORTH for all This?</H1>
Forth programmers have known for years that Forth provides a virtual 
machine, consisting of a data stack, a return stack and the registers IP, 
W, RP and SP.  It is amazing how much computing can be done with such a 
simple machine.  This machine needs only a small supplement to become an 
excellent virtual machine for all the tasks of boot code.  This supplement 
is the hardware dependent portion of the Open Firmware code, whether in 
the Fcode on a plug-in card, or in the Host's Open Firmware interpreter.<P>

<h1>Open Firmware for Debugging</h1>
In addition to providing a hardware independent method of building the 
device tree and providing boot drivers, Open Firmware provides a 
convenient FORTH environment for debugging new hardware and firmware.  
Suppose, for example, you need to test SCSI device capability, running 
with different devices in different parts of the chain of SCSI devices.  
You could write an endless loop as follows:<p>

<pre>
\ Generate the path name for the drive with the given SCSI-id
: diskno   30 +  pad c!  pad 1 ( scsi-id -- adr cnt)
  " /yourprocessorbus/XYZ,scsi@" cat2str ;
  
\ Use "open-dev" to open the disk w/ SCSI-ID "diskno", show the instance 
\ handle, then close it.
: testdisk  ( diskno --)
   diskno open-dev
   ." ihandle= "  dup .
   close-dev ;
   
: scsi-test ( --)
   begin
      probe-scsi-all
      7 0 do i testdisk loop
   key? until ;</pre><P>
   
If you need to test the ability to do real data transfers as well, you 
need only add the standard block-size/read calls via $call-method, as follows:<P>

<pre>
0 value my-ih
1000 alloc-mem constant TEST_BLOCK

: block-size ( --#bytes)
    " block-size" my-ih $call-method ;
    
: read ( bufadr #bytes-to-read -- #actual-read)
    " read" my-ih $call-method ;
    
: testdisk  ( diskno --)
   dup >r
   diskno open-dev
   ." ihandle= "  dup .   to my-ih
   test_block block-size read
   block-size - if ." ERROR READING BLOCK Disk: " r> . else r> drop then
   close-dev ;<\pre><P>
