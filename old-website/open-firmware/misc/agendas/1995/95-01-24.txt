NOTE 1: The PowerPC/PCMCIA/CHRP(PReP) Open Firmware focus group
will meet next Wednesday at the same place. Therefore, discussions on
these topics will be limited to issues that need to be discussed/examined/
voted by the general 1275 working group.


NOTE 2: DIRECTION to meeting location FIRMWORKS from Mitch Bradley
FirmWorks is located on San Antonio Road, between Central Expressway
and El Camino Real.

>From the San Jose airport, take US Hwy 101 north.  Get off at the
San Antonio Road exit and turn left, thus crossing over 101 on the
overpass.  Follow San Antonio Road for roughly one mile until you
go over another overpass (over Central Expressway).  From that
overpass a Firestone store is visible on the right hand side about
2 short blocks ahead.  FirmWorks is located in a office building
just behind that Firestone store.

If you get to El Camino Real, you have gone 1.5 blocks too far.

>From the San Francisco airport, take 101 south, get off at the first
San Antonio Road exit, and head in the direction that does not
take you over the 101 overpass, etc.

The address is 480 San Antonio Road.  FirmWorks is in suite 230, but
the meeting will be held in the downstairs conference room that
overlooks the atrium area.  There is no receptionist; just go directly
to the conference room.  It is visible from the front door, on the
other side of the pool of water.

Warning: Searching for the 400 block of San Antonio Road by number is
not a good technique.  San Antonio Road goes through 3 different cities,
each of which has a 400 block.  FirmWorks is in Mountain View, the middle
city, so the number search technique will get you stuck regardless of
which direction you are coming from!

Maps are available by FTP from firmworks.com in pub/maps, or browse the
firmworks.com WWW home page.

Convenient lodging is available at Rickey's Hyatt House, which is on
El Camino Real a few blocks north of San Antonio Road.  Maps to the
Hyatt are also on-line.
