NOTE: DIRECTION FROM THE AIRPORT TO MEETING PLACE

From the airport, get on I-35 South. There should be plenty of signs 
indicating how to do so.  

Take I-35 South to the William Cannon exit (commonly abbreviated Wm. Cannon).
Take a right on Wm. Cannon (west) and follow it for 5-7 miles through a
winding neighborhood.  Motorola is located on William Cannon; the building
will be on your left -- it's difficult to miss.

When turning into the main entrance, you'll take a right towards the parking 
garage and the EAST (H-Building) entrance. 

Visitor space is on the 2nd floor or any unassigned space. 
The entrance is on the 2nd floor and the guard at the front dest will be
able to issue your visitor badge and direct you to the meeting room.
