4. Hotel Reservations and Rates.

Our group arrangements with the hotel assume that we'll have a certain
number of attendees staying at the hotel and booking the prearranged
Open Firmware Working Group rate of $139 per night.  This group rate
is lower than the corporate rate.

The group rate is available for check-in on Saturday, 11 January 1997
through check-out on Wednesday, 15 January 1997.  We'll meet as a group
on Monday and Tuesday, January 13 - 14. You can book any subset of the
available time at the group rate.

Please be sure to have your travel department make your reservations
directly with the hotel in order to get the Open Firmware Working Group
prearranged group rate.

	NOTE: All reservations at the group rate must be made
	      directly with the hotel before 20 December 1996.

5. Directions to the SLC Marriott.

The SLC Marriott is located on South West Temple, right in downtown
Salt Lake City, near the main temple, across the street from the
Ice Palace.

The hotel is no more than 20 minutes from the airport.
Many restaurants are available within walking distance
of the hotel, and public transportation is available
to many area ski resorts, so a rental car isn't necessary.

More detailed information will be provided at a later date.
