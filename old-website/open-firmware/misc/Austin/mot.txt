Directions to Moto for the June Meeting:

from the airport, get on I-35 South. There should be plenty of signs 
indicating how to do so.  Take I-35 South to the William Cannon exit.
(commonly abbreviated Wm. Cannon).  Take a right on Wm. Cannon (west)
and follow it for 5-7 miles through a winding neighborhood.  Motorola is 
located on William Cannon; the building will be on your left -- it's
difficult to miss.

When turning into the main entrance, you'll take a right towards the parking 
garage and the EAST (H-Building) entrance. Visitor space is on the 2nd floor 
or any unassigned space. The entrance is on the 2nd floor and the guard at the
front dest will be able to issue your visitor badge and direct you to the 
meeting room. Like always, we'll be there starting at 8; meeting to start at 9.

HOWEVER, if you don't like my text-based directions, e-mail me back
and I'll fax you a map.
