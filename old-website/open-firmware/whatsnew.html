<h3>New Mirror Site and Changes to Site Organization.</h3>

<h4>Mirror At Apple Computer Inc.</h4>

Thanks and kudos do David "Lefty" Schlesinger and Apple Computer Inc
for hosting our new mirror site:
<a href = "http://chrp.apple.com/1275/">
<i>http://chrp.apple.com/1275/</i></a>.

<h4>Site Organization</h4>

If you maintain external links to specific sections of this
site's web pages, then this applies to you.

<p>
The main page, known as <i>index.html</i> is now an entry page
asking you to select a site.  The main content page is now
known as "/open-firmware/home.html" at both sites. Note that this may
require some changes to those linking to specific  sections
of the main pages ... please add <i>home.html</i> to those links
and remove the "/pub/1275" part of that path, which is no
longer necesary or desired at either site.
