<h2>Updates to PPC Binding in Version 1.10 DRAFT</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Page 7, line 26: [editorial] fix URL
<li>Page 7, line 50: [review comment] Strike "Open Firmware and its client 
are running with translation disabled; "
<li>Page 10, line 3: [review comment] Replace paragraph with:
"If the client program has specific requirements for physical memory or 
address space usage, it may establish requirements for OF's physical and/or 
virtual address space usage by means of its program header.  When OF loads 
the client program, it inspects the program header, and if its current usage 
of physical memory or virtual address space conflicts with that specified in 
the program header, OF shall set the real-base, real-size, virt-base, and 
virt-size to the configuration variables as specified in the header and 
restart itself.  Real-base, real-size, virt-base, and virt-size may be 
specified as -1, in which case the firmware is permitted to choose 
appropriate values for the variables specified as -1."
<li>Page 10, line 7: [review comment] Replace paragraph with:
"If the values of the real-size and/or virt-size configuration varables do 
not provide sufficient memory and/or virtual address space for the 
firmware's own use, then the firmware shall not attempt to load a client 
program and the condition should be reported to the user.  The possibility 
of not being able to comply with limitiations on firmware's size should be 
tested as the firmware is coming up in order to handle the possibility that 
a user established an unworkable limitation on the size."
<li>Page 10, line 8: [Proposal 317] Add "Clients can minimize this 
exposure by setting size to -1 and allowing Open Firmware to choose 
the size."
<li>Page 10, line 20: [Proposal 313 discussion] Add "and implementation 
specific areas" following "used for interrupt vectors."
<li>Page 11, lines 22-23: [review comment] Add "The client shall also 
ensure that other processors do not generate translation exceptions for 
the duration of the call."
<li>Page 11, line 24: [review comment] Insert: Client programs are not 
required to assume responsibility for physical memory management. 
<li>Page 11, lines 24-27: [Proposal 317] Replace paragraph with:
"The client program must use the Open Firmware claim client interface 
service to allocate physical memory while physical memory is managed by 
Open Firmware.  Physical memory shall remain managed by Open Firmware 
until the client program defines the real-mode physical memory management 
assist callbacks.  Physical memory must be managed by the client program 
once the client program defines the real-mode physical memory management
assist callbacks.  Open Firmware shall use the client program's real-mode 
physical memory management assist callbacks to allocate physical memory 
after the client program has assumed physical memory management."
<li>Page 11, lines 24-27: [review comment] Change sentence prior to ";"
to read "Hence, this binding defines callback services that the client 
provides for use by Open Firmware"
<li>Page 13, lines 27-29: [Proposal 317] Change "unit-number" to 
"unit-address"
<li>Page 14, lines 43-47: [review comment] delete "cpu-state" property
since this information is available in /chosen.  I.e., the chosen cpu
is running and all others are stopped.
<li>Page 16, line 2: [Proposal 317] Add the following properties:
<pre>
      "tlb-split"

         This property, if present, shall indicate that the TLB has a
         split organization. The absence of this property shall indicate
         that the TLB has a unified organization.

      "d-tlb-size"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents the total number of d-TLB entries.

      "d-tlb-sets"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents the number of associativity sets of the d-TLB.
         A value of 1 indicates that the d-TLB is fully-associative.

      "i-tlb-size"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents the total number of i-TLB entries.

      "i-tlb-sets"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents the number of associativity sets of the i-TLB.
         A value of 1 indicates that the i-TLB is fully-associative.

</pre>
<li>Page 16, line 39: [Proposal 317] Add the following properties and note:
<pre>
      "i-cache-line-size"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents this instruction cache's line size,
         in bytes, if different than its block size.

      "d-cache-line-size"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents this data cache's line size, in bytes, if
         different than its block size.

      Note: If this is a unified cache, the corresponding i- and
      d- sizes must be equal.

</pre>
<li>Page 17, line 13: [review comment] change "device-type" to "device_type"; 
do a global check and fix all.
<li>Page 17, line 39: [Proposal 317] Add the following properties and note:
<pre>
      "i-cache-line-size"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents this instruction cache's line size,
         in bytes, if different than its block size.

      "d-cache-line-size"

         Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that
         represents this data cache's line size, in bytes, if
         different than its block size.

      Note: If this is a unified cache, the corresponding i- and
      d- sizes must be equal.

</pre>
<li>Page 18, line 32: [Proposal 317 with comments] Add the segment 
registers to Table 1 and split Table 1 into sections: real-mode and 
virt-mode; change "preserved by client interface" to "client interface 
shall preserve"; add definition for preserved - same value when 
returing; indicate that the msr, segment registers & sprg registers 
shall not be modified by the client interface in virtual mode; indicate 
that the msr, segment registers & sprg registers shall be preserved 
by the client interface in real mode; remove '%' signs in this section.
<li>Page 19, lines 8-15: [Proposal 317 and comments] replace the 3rd and 
4th sentences with the definition of load-base.  Add the following to the
end of the paragraph: "All of physical memory from load-base to either the 
start of Open Firmware physical memory or the end of physical memory,
whichever comes first, shall be available for loading the client program."
<li>Page 19, Table 2: [review comment] Change "Others" to "Other user mode 
registers"; remove '%' signs in this section.
<li>Page 20, line 40 [Proposal 317, comments and follow-up] After the 
first sentence add: "The I cache shall be consistent with the D cache for 
all memory areas occupied by the client program."
<li>Page 20, line 43 [Proposal 317, comments and follow-up] after line 43 add:
<pre>
	"All processors in a SMP system shall have the same consistent view 
	of all memory areas (for data references).  No more than one 
	processor shall have a modified copy of the same data area in its 
	cache when the client program is called.

	Note: If firmware makes cachable M=0 data references from different 
            processors on a SMP system, it may have to perform additional 
            cache management to meet this requirement."
</pre>
<li>Page 22, lines 52-54: [Proposal 317] Move to follow line 12.
