It would not be a good idea to expand the scope of 1275.3 to embrace VME64:
    the 32-bit VME Bus specification and the 64-bit VME64 specification are
    sufficiently different that their Open Firmware specifications should
    be treated separately.

Recent changes, concerning the matter of which standards organization has
    ownership of the VME Bus specification, further militate in favor of
    making the VME64/Open-Firmware specification the focus of another work.

The last three sentences in the Overview, page 1 lines 6-10, are intended
    to be an adequate disclaimer to the effect that the 64-bit version of
    the VME specification is not addressed in this document.

Nonetheless, the "Overview" section and reference [2] have been changed,
    to reflect the current situation, as follows:


Last two sentences in the Overview:

	Extensions to the 32-bit IEEE standard introduced in the newer
	    VME64 bus standard, ANSI/VITA-1 1995, which specifies a
	    maximum address space of 64 bits, are outside the scope of
	    this standard.  All references to VME or to VMEbus within
	    this standard refer specifically to the older ANSI/IEEE
	    1014-1987 VME Standard specification.

Reference [2], add:

	This specification has been withdrawn as an IEEE standard, but can
	    still be obtained from VITA, 10229 N. Scottsdale Road, Suite B,
	    Scottsdale, AZ 85253-1437, USA; Telephone: (602) 951-8866.

(1) The heading for Section 3 is changed from "Terms",
    to "Terms and Conventions" and Section 3.7 is added,
    to read as follows:

	3.7.  Bus Line names and abbreviations, when given, follow the
	      conventions of Reference [2].  An asterisk (*) at the end
	      of a Bus Line name indicates that the line is "active low".

(2) The reference to "phys.lo" in the sentence beginning on line 46 of
    page 2 is a typographical error and should read "phys.hi".  This
    will render the sentence in question correct and in the proper
    place.  This was caught by other respondents, as well, and has
    been corrected in the new revision.

(1) Since the Supplements to 1275 lose most of their meaning outside of the
    context of the Core specification, it is a reasonably safe assumption
    that the reader of any of them will also have access to the Core.  For
    this reason, none of the Supplements does more than make reference to
    the Core terminology to describe terms already defined therein.  The
    same applies to this Supplement.

(2) Please recheck your edition of the VME Standard.  I believe you might
    have been looking at the newer 64-bit VME specification, which is a
    superset of older ANSI/IEEE 1014-1987 VME Standard specification, to
    which this standard specifically refers.

(3) The standard _names_ for these signals are spelled out in full in the
    VME Standard, on page 125, and are copied correctly in P1275.3 Draft 8.
    The abbreviations, as shown in the VME Standard, are:  BBSY*  BCLR*
    and  BR0*  BR1*  BR2*  and  BR3*  (the * indicates "active-low").
    These abbreviations have been added, parenthetically, to the line in
    question.

(4) The "reg" property is well defined in the 1275 Core Standard.  However,
    the word "format" in that line was a typographical error and has been
    removed.

(5) Yes this should.  This will be corrected in the next revision.

(6) The standard interrupts property is well defined in the 1275 Core.

(7) The function returns a boolean flag, for which the TRUE value indicates
    that the operation proceded successfully (i.e., "went okay").  This
    notation is described near the beginning of Annex A in the 1275 Core
    Standard.

(8) If you are asking about boards that are capable of returning several
    different vectors or status/IDs for a given interrupt level, this is
    not a problem, nor does it conflict with any assumptions.  As is al-
    ready stated in the specification, the device node corresponding to
    such a board would simply include, in its  interrupts   property, an
    entry for each level and vector combination the board might generate.
    To extend the example given, suppose a device generates VMEbus Inter-
    rupt Request level 3 and under some circumstances asserts the vector
    c0 during the Interrupt Acknowledge cycle, and under other circumstan-
    ces asserts the vector f3.  The interrupts  property would include the
    pair  3,c0  and the pair  3,f3  in its list.

    If, on the other hand, you are asking about boards whose VMEbus Inter-
    rupt Request levels and vectors or status/IDs are programmable by the
    O/S, then this, too, is not a problem.  The device node firmware, at
    boot time, would list the level and vector combinations that apply to
    the board's state at the time the O/S is first started up, and the O/S
    would bear the responsibility of keeping track of the subsequent state
    of the programmable functions of the device.

Thank you.  It appears that balloting for the VME Supplement will need to
    go into recirculation.  Your support at that time will be appreciated.

You're absolutely right.  I couldn't agree more.  The above changes are
    incorporated into the new revision of the document.
