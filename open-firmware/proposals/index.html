351: Suggested Changes published in #356 (minutes of Apr 30 - May 1 meeting)
351: Author to resubmit a new draft with changes discussed at the meeting.
351:
351:  - page 4, line 4: "EtherNet" should be "MAC".
351:  - page 4, line 51: "client" should be "server".
351:  - page 6, line 5: allow literal string "bootp" ahead of the first
351:          argument. Also allow giaddr, bootp-retries, and tftp-retries
351:          to be optional.
351:  - Check if subnet-mask is required.
351:  - Fix use of "%NONE%".
351:  - Look into IPMG impact.
351:  - Eliminate the methods.
351:  - Eliminate the new/changed semantics of open:
351:       obp-tftp open shouldn't do anything 'extra'.
351:       Perhaps obp-tftp open gets called at 'load' time.
351:  - Implement the ping user interface as an external word that
351:       understands the ip protocol.
351:  - Change the arguments to open:
351:       "promiscuous,..." - Eaten by network device
351:       "bootp,..." - Play bootp, allow some args to be specified.
351:       ... - No bootp, use arguments specified on the command line.
351:  - Delete the methods and publish the initial bootreply packet
351:       as encoded-bytes in /chosen. (obp-tftp).

255:  The exit service must continue to work after a set-callback that takes

317:0 Closed: Accepted with amendments
317:1 Amendments:
317:2   Page 10, line 3: Replace entire paragraph:
317:3     "If the client program has specific requirements for physical
317:4      memory or address space usage, it may establish requirements
317:5      for OF's physical and/or virtual address space usage by means
317:6      of its program header.  When OF loads the client program, it
317:7      inspects the program header, and if its current usage of
317:8      physical memory or virtual address space conflicts with that
317:9      specified in the program header, OF shall set the real-base,
317:0     real-size, virt-base, and virt-size to the configuration
317:1     variables as specified in the header and restart itself.
317:2     real-base, virt-base, real-size and virt-size may be specified
317:3     as -1, in which case the firmware is permitted to choose
317:4     appropriate values for the variables specified as -1."
317:5  Page 10, line 7: Replace paragraph beginning at line 7:
317:6    "If the values of the real-size and/or virt-size config vars do
317:7     not provide sufficient memory and/or virtual address space for
317:8     the firmware's own use, then the firmware shall not attempt to
317:9     load a client program and the condition should be reported to
317:0     the user.  The possibility of not being able to comply with
317:1     limitiations on firmware's size should be tested as the
317:2     firmware is coming up in order to handle the possibility that
317:3     a user established an unworkable limitation on the size."
317:4
317:5    Add "Clients can minimize this exposure by setting the size to
317:6     -1 and allowing Open Firmware to choose the size."
317:7  Page 11, lines 24-27: Client programs are not required to assume
317:8     responsibility for physical memory management. Put at beginning
317:9     of paragraph. State in both pos and neg context.
317:0  Page 18: split Table 1 into sections: real-mode and virt-mode;
317:1     change "preserved by client interface" to "client interface shall
317:2     preserve"; add definition for preserved - same value when returing;
317:3     indicate that the msr, segment registers & sprg registers shall
317:4     not be modified by the client interface in virtual mode; indicate
317:5     that the msr, segment registers & sprg registers shall be preserved
317:6     by the client interface in real mode; remove '%' signs in this
317:7     section.
317:8  Page 19, Table 2: Change "Others" to "Other user mode registers".
317:9  Page 19, lines 8-15: replace the 3rd and 4th sentences with the def.
317:0     of load-base.  Add the proposed sentence to the end of the paragraph.
317:1  Page 20, line 40: After the first sentence add:
317:2     "The I cache shall be consistent with the D cache for all
317:3     memory areas occupied by the client program."
317:4  Page 20, after line 43: Add:
317:5      "All processors in a SMP system shall have the same
317:6      consistent view of all memory areas (for data references).
317:7      No more than one processor shall have a modified copy of
317:8      the same data area in its cache when the client program
317:9      is called.
317:0        Note: If firmware makes cachable M=0 data references from
317:1          different processors on a SMP system, it may have to
317:2          perform additional cache management to meet this
317:3          requirement."
317:4  Page 22, line 30: Segment Register's sentence, don't add.
317:5  Page 22, lines 52-54: Move lines to behind line 12.
