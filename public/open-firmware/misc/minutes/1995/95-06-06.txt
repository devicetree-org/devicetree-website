2- Review Agenda

Proposed agenda was reviewed and approved 15-0-0.


3- Last meeting minutes review

Vote passed to approve the last meeting minutes with admendment to: (1) change
status of proposal #252 to #263 and #265 from passed to closed and remanded
to the PowerPC workgroup, and (2) clarify proposal #TBD1 to relate it to
"set-font" argument. 

4- Standard Progress Report

1275.3: The ballot package including the standard and cover letter will be
shipped to IEEE Monday, 5 June.

1275.4: Mitch and Martin were unable to sway the lone dissenting voter. We 
are not sure to what extent Mitch will able to talk with him further. So we
decide to do the recirculation.  Martin will send the recirc package to IEEE on Monday June 05,1995.
The package includes the comments from the dissenting vote and the
commitee responses along with a cover letter.


1275.6: It is still in ballot.  We have not heard anything from IEEE office
with respect to the preliminary results.  The ballot will close on June 12,
1995 so Martin should get something soon. Perhaps Martin has not received anything because of his carreer move to different company. But he promises
that he will call IEEE office on Monday June 05, 1995, and as soon as he gets any preliminary feedback, he will post to 1275-wg.

Bob Coffins also reported his trip to the PCMCIA committee meeting in France.
 

5- Action Items Review

The following AIs are still opened:
* Mitch: to follow up TI patent issue with Harrison Beasley. Open, pending on
  Ron's effort to check on TI licensing/royalty on NuBusthat may provide a
  path to solve this patent issue. Mitch to also e-mail Ron, Luan and Bob the
  patent number. 
* Kip: to make formal proposal on ARC Terminal. Open, to be done in the next
  two weeks. 
* Dave Trissell: COFF and PE writings are still open. Kip to remind and work
  with Dave.


6- Future Meetings

July 18, 1995:  to be hosted by FirmWorks Inc, Mountain View, CA. Mitch will
                also host July 19, 1995 binding meetings.
Sept. 19, 1995: to be host by IBM Austin, TX. IBM will also host binding
                meetings on Sept 20, 1995.
Oct. 31, 1995:  to be hosted by FirmWorks Inc, Mountain View, CA. Mitch will
                also host November 1st, 1995 binding meetings.


7- Errata document (.7): AI to update this document per discussion


8- Recommended Practice boiler template:

The following is the text for 1.3 boiler template for recommended practice 
documents that was approved by the committee during this meeting:

This document is a voluntary-use recommended practice of the Open
Firmware Working Group. The Open Firmware Working Group is an ad hoc
committee composed of individuals interested in Open Firmware as
defined by IEEE 1275-1994, related standards, and their application to
various computer systems.

The Open Firmware Working Group is involved both in IEEE sanctioned
standards activities whose final results are published by IEEE and in
informal recommendations such as this, which are published on the
internet at ftp://playground.sun.com/pub/p1275.

Membership in the Open Firmware Working Group is open to all interested
parties. The working group meets at regular intervals at various
locations. For more information send email to p1275-wg@prombo.eng.sun.com.


9- Open Firmware: Recommended Practice - 16-color Text Extension

For the color table in the 16-color text extension, modify as follows:

Various support packages use numbers from 0 to 15 to represent colors.
The table below defines the sixteen colors in terms of  the approximate
intensities of red, green, and blue (0 for no intensity and 1 for
maximum intensity). The use of these color numbers does not necessarily
imply that the hardware uses a color lookup table, nor does the
description of the colors imply that the hardware uses an RGB color
space.


10- Open Firmware: Recommended Practice - Graphics Extension

Change the name to 8-bit graphics extension

Add the following text:
If a display device driver implements both the 8-bit graphics extension
and the 16-color text extension, it shall initialize the first 16 color
numbers to correspond to the colors indicated in Table 1 in the
16-color text extension. A client program can use those colors without
explicitly initializing them. If a client program changes the color
assignment for color indexes 0-15, the behavior of the 16-color text
extension might be affected.
