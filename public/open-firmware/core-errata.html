<a name = "389">
Stack Diagram Error in <i>endcase</i> AND <i>b(endcase)</i>
</a>
</h2>

<p>This item is authorized by OFWG
<a href = "proposals/index.html#389">Proposal #389</a>.

<p>The run-time stack diagram for <strong>endcase</strong>
and <strong>b(endcase)</strong>
in 1275 disagrees with the stack diagram for <strong>ENDCASE</strong>
in ANS Forth.

<p>It should be (corrected) as:
<pre>
	endcase		( sel -- )
</pre>

<p>It should <strong>not</strong> be (as published in the core document):
<pre>
	( sel | &lt nothing &gt -- ).
</pre>

<p>The <i>&lt nothing &gt</i> case does not
exist, because <strong>endof</strong> transfers control to the point
just <i>after</i> <strong>endcase</strong>.  The run-time action of
<strong>endcase</strong> executes only when no <strong>of</strong>
clause succeeded, i.e. the <i>default</i> case.</p>

<p>
I think this is just a documentation
error, because I'm not aware of any implementation that
does the wrong thing.</p>

<h2>
<a name = "396">
Fix SCSI example usage of <i>max-transfer</i>
</a>
</h2>

<p>This item is authorized by OFWG
<a href = "proposals/index.html#396">Proposal #396</a>.

<p>The definition of <i>max-transfer</i> requires it to be
rounded down to a multiple of <i>block-size</i>. The sample
SCSI driver in Annex E sets <i>max-transfer</i> to <bold>
h# 7f.ffff</bold>.
<i>Block-size</i> is generally a power of two, often 512 bytes.

<p>Change the value of <i>max-transfer</i> in annex E to
<bold>h# 80.0000</bold> which is a power of two:
<pre>
	: max-transfer ( -- n )
	    " max-transfer" ['] $call-parent catch if 2drop h# 80.0000 then
	;

</pre>

<h2>
<a name = "404">
SCSI annex: <i>Medium not present</i> should not be retryable
</a>
</h2>

<p>This item is authorized by OFWG
<a href = "proposals/index.html#404">Proposal #404</a>.

<p>
Refer to 1275-1994, Annex E (SCSI Host Adapter Package Class), Sections
E3.2.2, definition of "retry-command", and the sample implementation of
"classify-sense" in E6.3 "hacom.fth".

<p>
The classification of the "not ready" sense key (sense key value 2) as
"retryable" is too general.  One of the subcases of "not ready" is
"medium not present", as indicated by an Additional Sense Code (the byte
at sense data offset decimal 12) value of hex 3A and an Additional Sense
Code Qualifier (the byte at sense data offset decimal 13) value of 0.

<p>
In order for a sense condition to be properly classified as "retryable",
it should be self-correcting, so that the overall operation is likely to
eventually succeed if it is retried enough times.  "Medium not present"
is not a self-correcting condition, so it should not be retried.

<p>
One specific situation in which this problem shows up is when the list
of boot devices (i.e. the value of the "boot-file" configuration variable)
contains a tape drive at some position other than the end of the list.
Typically, the desired behavior in such a situation is for the system to
boot from the tape drive if a tape is present, otherwise to proceed to the
next device in the list.  If "medium not present" is retryable, the system
will instead wait indefinitely for a tape to be inserted.

<p>
In addition to this problem, the example code for "classify-sense" in E6.3
also fails to handle the "9) Transaction aborted ..." case listed on P223
L33.


<p>

<pre>

On 1275-1994 P223 L31 (and the identical line in the SPI binding):

  Replace:

	7) sense key = Not Ready is retryable

  With:

	7) sense key = Not Ready is:
	    - not retryable if Additional Sense Code = 0x3A
	      and Additional Sense Code Qualifier = 0
	      (thus indicating "medium not present")
	    - retryable otherwise

On 1275-1994 P229 L54-55:

  Replace:

	\ not-ready(2) and attention(6) are retryable
	dup 2 =  swap 6 =  or  if 1  else  -1  then

  With:

	\ not-ready(2) may be retryable
	dup 2 =  if
	   \ check (tapes, especially) for MEDIUM NOT PRESENT: if the
	   \ medium's not there the command is not retryable
	   drop sense-buf h# c + c@  h# 3a =  sense-buf h# d + c@ 0=  and
	   if  -1  else  1  then
	   exit
	then

	\ attention(6), and target aborted (b) are retryable.
	dup 6 =  swap 0b =  or if  1  else  -1  then

<h2>
<a name = "425">
SCSI annex: Fix implementation of <i>show-lun</i></a>
</a>
</h2>

<p>This item is authorized by OFWG
<a href = "proposals/index.html#425">Proposal #425</a>.

<p>
Refer to 1275-1994, Annex E (SCSI Host Adapter Package Class), Sections
E6.2, the sample implementation of the "show-lun" method in hacom.fth.

<p>
The current implementation of the "show-lun" method neglects to
take into account a returned Qualifier value of 1h.  This results
in the misleading display of disconnected Logical Units.

<p>
What seems like an attempt to print the Qualifier value is actually
an attempt to print the SCSI-1 Device Modifier value, which is usually
00h and no longer supported.

<p>
Make the following Change:

<p>
Change the line which tests for both a Qualifier of 3h and a Device
Type of 1Fh so that it's behavior is identical for all non-zero
Qualifier values (Vendor-specific values excepted) ...

<p>
<pre>
Replace:
	0 inq@	h# 7f =   if drop exit	then		( unit )

With:
	0 inq@	h# 60 and if drop exit	then		( unit )

</pre>

<p>
Remove the line which attempts to display a Qualifier value ...

<pre>
Remove:
	1 inq@	h# 7f and ?dup  if ." Qualifier  " .h then

</pre>

<p>
Refer to
<a href = "proposals/index.html#425">Proposal #425</a>
for a replacement version of the <i>show-lun</i>
method.

<h2>
<a name = "440">
Clarify the return value from the <i>set-callback</i> client interface
</a>
</h2>

<p>This item is authorized by OFWG
<a href = "proposals/index.html#440">Proposal #440</a>.

<p>
The definition of the <i>set-callback</i> client interface
in section 6.3.2.6 of the core document fails to specify the
value returned if the previous callback handler is <i>unset</i>.

<p>
The following text augments the definition of the <i>set-callback</i>
client interface, originally defined in section 6.3.2.6 of
the core specification.

<p>
Change the last sentence of the first paragraph of text in
the <i>set-callback</i> description to:

<pre>
	The service sets the callback handler to *newfunc*
	and returns in *oldfunc* the address of the entry
	point of the previously installed callback handler
	or the value zero if there is no previously installed
	callback handler.
