   Administrivia:

     A new web page mirror sight has been created by CodeGen at
     www.openfirmware.org
     Ron H. inquired as to the interest by other work group members in AGP.
     Specifically, should this be handled as a new binding or a feature of
     the PCI binding? There was feed back from various members but no
     specific action taken.
     ANSI Forth reaffirmation report by Mitch Bradley:
        Changes in character definitions for internationalization plus
        other minor extensions.
        Targeted to be complete the end of 1999.
