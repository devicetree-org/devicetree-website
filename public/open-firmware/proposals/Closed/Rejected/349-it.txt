Subject: Item #349: PCI Bindings: clarify use of probe-pci


P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:349 Ver 1

Title:          PCI Binding: Add clarity to the use of probe-pci

Author:         Paul Thomas

Date:           April 23, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Editorial

Synopsis:       Disambiguate probe-pci a little

Doc & Version:  PCI Bindings, 1.6

Problem:        The description for probe-pci doesn't make sense for a
system with multiple PCI buses.  It should be made clear that probe-pci
applies only to a system with one built-in PCI, and only to that PCI.
(This nit was revealed while reviewing some PCI code.)

Proposal:       

The content of the change should follow the practice for probe-sbus in the
SBus binding.  Specifically, I propose:

1. Change p 15, l 24-25, to read:

An Open Firmware-compliant User Interface on a system with a single built-in
PCI bus _should_ implement the following PCI-specific user interface command.


2. Insert between p 16, l 44 and l 45, the following text:

An Open Firmware-compliant User Interface on a system with a built-in PCI bus
_should_ implement the following PCI-specific user interface commands.
