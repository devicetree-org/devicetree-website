Subject: Item #295: Dev Ext: Consistent Properties for Sound Devices

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #295
#pragma ident	"@(#)1275.2	1.4	95/10/19"

Title:		Consistent Properties for Sound Devices

Author:		Vicki.Abe@west.sun.com

Date:		October 13, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Make audio properties consistent; they should describe
		either overall device capabilities -or- current values.

Doc & Version:	Device Support Extensions to IEEE1275-1994 Draft 0.3 08/17/95

Problem:	The interface is inconsistent and incomplete; some properties,
		such as "sample-rates" are an array of integers that describe
		all sampling rates supported by the device, while others, such
		as "sample-resolution", are simply a single integer, even
		though the chip may be able to operate at different levels of
		resolution.  It is unclear whether these properties represent
		the full range of device capabilities or just the current
		(post-reset) operating mode.

		In the context of the Open Firmware operating environment,
		it makes more sense to report current device settings,
		rather than overall device capabilities. 
		
		The following changes are recommended to standardize
		generic audio properties:

Proposal:	(Section 6.1, "sound" device standard properties)

1. replace the text in page 5, lines 32-34, with:

	"#channels"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	number of channels supported by the device.

		to

	"#input-channels"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	currently set number of input audio channels.  Valid values will
	depend on the channel mode(s) supported by the device.
	(Example: "1" or "2").

	"#output-channels"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	currently set number of output audio channels.  Valid values will
	depend on the channel mode(s) supported by the device.

	"#DMA-channels"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	currently set number of DMA channels.  Valid values will depend on
	the number of DMA channels supported by the device.
	(Example: on the CS423x, valid values would be "1" or "2").

2. change the text on page 5, lines 36-38, from:

	"sample-resolution"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	number of bits of resolution for each sound sample.

		to

	"sample-precision"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	number of bits used to store an audio sample from one channel.  Valid
	values will reflect precision(s) supported by the device.

3. change the text on page 5, lines 39-42, from:

	"sample-width"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	number of bytes required for storing a sample.

		to

	"sample-frame-size"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	number of bits required to store one sample frame.  Valid values
	will depend on the modes supported by the device.


4. change the text on page 5, lines 43-46, from

	"sample-rates"

	Standard property, consisting of an array of integers, each encoded
	as with encode-int, that represents the rates (in hertz) at which
	this device can be sampled.

		to

	"input-sample-rate"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	currently set input sampling rate of the audio device.  Valid values
	will depend on the input sampling rates supported by the device.

	"output-sample-rate"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that represents the
	currently set output sampling rate of the audio device. Valid values
	will depend on the output sampling rates supported by the device.
	(Example: on the CS423x, the list of valid values would include
	5.5, 6.62, 8.0, 9.6, 11.025, 16.0, 18.9, 27.42, 22.05, 32.0, 33.075,
	37.8, 44.1, 48.0) (Ksamples/second)

5. insert at line 13 these new properties:

	"input-encoding-type"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-string, that represents
	the current set input encoding format of the audio device.  Valid
	values for this property shall be one of "8bit_ulaw", "8bit_alaw",
	"8bit_unsigned_linear", "8bit_signed_linear",
	"16bit_LE_unsigned_linear", "16bit_BE_unsigned_linear",
	"16bit_LE_signed_linear", "16bit_BE_signed_linear", or "4bit_ADPCM",
	i.e., some value that is supported by the device.

	"output-encoding-type"

	Standard property, encoded as with encode-string, that represents
	the current set output encoding format of the audio device.  Valid
	values for this property shall be one of "8bit_ulaw", "8bit_alaw",
	"8bit_unsigned_linear", "8bit_signed_linear",
	"16bit_LE_unsigned_linear", "16bit_BE_unsigned_linear",
	"16bit_LE_signed_linear", "16bit_BE_signed_linear", or "4bit_ADPCM",
	i.e., some value that is supported by the device.


Glossary

	Precision - the size (in bits) per each sample (per channel).

	Sample Frame - in cases where there are multiple channels of audio
		data, a sample frame consists of interleaved samples, one
		from each channel.

	Sampling Rate - the number of sample frames per second.

Rationale

	While the support offered through Open Firmware is not meant to
	serve as a fully functional driver, there is however a great deal of
	variation between the "standard audio formats" expected by different
	operating systems.

	Since Open Firmware is designed to be OS-independent, we should
	allow each vendor to set default audio properties that make sense
	for the target platform and operating system.  The default values
	used on a SPARC for Solaris (8-bit ulaw) would differ from those
	used for a PowerPC running NT (16-bit little-endian signed linear),
	or a PowerMac (16-bit big-endian AIFF).

	Specifying these properties in detail now, but providing for
	some flexibility would allow for future usage across platforms.
