Subject: Item #266: Recommended Practice (Core, PCI): Revisit Generic Names #251


P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #266 Ver <v1.0>

Title:		Revisit Generic Names Recomended Practice (re: #251)

Author:		David Kahn

Date:		19 April 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Revisit the decision on proposal #251

Doc & Version:	Appected Proposal Number 251.Item

Scope:		Recomended Practice

Problem:	If proposal 251 (generic names) will not be adopted
		by this body as a recomended practice, the committee
		should revisit that decision and recommend against #251.

Proposal:	

Change the status of proposal #251 to rejected. (Initially accepted,
but subsequently rejected.)

Discussion ...

Proposal #251 was adopted as a recommended practice at the last
working group meeting, and has significant impact on the current
work of various companies.  Apple will not be able to support
#251 in documentation or in the OS. It's also not likely for
Sun to get this support into our next OS, either.

It became clear that #251 would not be adopted accross the industry
after the meeting.  I think the body should revisit the decision to
support proposal #251.

It would be nice if we can come up with a way to support a better
form of names on PCI than the default pci<vvvv>,<dddd>, in conjunction
with the current standards. Alternatively, come up with better
aliasing mechanisms, and graphical views of the device tree, with
pop-up information giving the device_type and properties of each
device node, to solve the ease-of-use issues. All of these methods
could be adopted as value added enhancements, using the current
standard plus extensions voted as recommended practices at the
last meeting.
