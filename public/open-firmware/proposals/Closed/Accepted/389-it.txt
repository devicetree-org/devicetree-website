Subject: Item #389: Core: Stack diagram error in endcase and b(endcase)

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #389 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:		Stack diagram error in endcase and b(endcase)

Author:		Mitch Bradley

Date:		September 9, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	The stack diagram for endcase and b(endcase) is wrong

Doc & Version:	1275-1994

Problem:	The run-time stack diagram for endcase and b(endcase)
		in 1275 disagrees with the stack diagram for ENDCASE
		in ANS Forth.  It should be ( sel -- ), not
		( sel | <nothing> -- ).  The <nothing> case does not
		exist, because endof transfers control to the point
		just *after* endcase.  The run-time action of endcase
		executes only when no "of" clause succeeded, i.e. the
		default case.  I think this is just a documentation
		error, because I'm not aware of any implementation that
		does the wrong thing.

Proposal:	

1) On the Web page, move the link to the "core errata" document so that it
   appears near the link to the core document.

2) Create an on-line document named "additional errata", with a link located
   just after the link to the core errata document.  Add to that document
   the text in the "Problem" section above.

3) If and when we do another revision of the IEEE core errata document,
   incorporate the contents of the on-line additional errata document
   into the IEEE document.
