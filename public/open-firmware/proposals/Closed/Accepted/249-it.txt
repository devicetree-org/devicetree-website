Subject: Item #249: PCI binding, "clock-frequency" bus node property

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #249 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          new bus node property -- "clock-frequency"

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           March 10, 1995

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       add new "clock-frequency" property to bus nodes

Doc & Version:  PCI Binding 1.4

Problem:        Some cards need to know the PCI clock frequency, which is
                currently not reported.

Proposal:

Add the following words to the section: "Bus-specific Properties for Bus Nodes"

"clock-frequency"
    Standard prop-name to define the frequency at which the PCI bus (defined
    by this bus node) is clocked.

    prop-encoded-array:  an integer, encoded as with *encode-int*, that
    specifies the PCI clock frequency, in hertz.

****NOTE****
I meant to bring this up for Tuesday's meeting, but it got lost in the shuffle.
I would like to add it to the updates that I am making for 1.5, based upon what
was agreed to this week.

So, could all interested parties please give this your immediate attention, and
let me know if you have any major concerns.

Ron.
