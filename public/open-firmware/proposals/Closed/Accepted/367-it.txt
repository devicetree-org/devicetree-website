P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #367 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          Update PCI Binding ranges property

Author:         John Kingman

Date:           June 18, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Editorial

Synopsis:       Make ranges property elidable

Doc & Version:  PCI Binding Ver 1.75 Unapproved Draft

Problem:        PCI Binding says that a PCI-PCI Bridge _shall_ have a
                ranges property, even if the bridge doesn't map any 
                addresses through.

Proposal:       

Page 15, line 8: add to the end of the first sentence - "if any address
                spaces are mapped through the bridge."
