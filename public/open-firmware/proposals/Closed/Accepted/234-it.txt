Subject: Item #234: Clarify set-symbol-lookup client intfc. (Core errata)

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #234 Ver 1

Title:		Clarify set-symbol-lookup client interface (Core errata)

Author:		David M. Kahn

Date:		Feb 13, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Specify service name for set-symbol-lookup callbacks

Doc & Version:	P1275.7/Core Errata

Problem:	The description of the "set-symbol-lookup" client interface
		service omits to specify the service name at the time
		the callback is executed.  Client programs should be able
		to use a single callback handler mechanism, and switch
		on the service name to select and provide the service.
		If the service name is unspecified, this cannot be done.

Proposal:	

The wording to be added is on D12/Page 80:

After 80:23 add:

	The service name string in the argument array is a pointer
	to a NULL terminated string containing "sym-to-value".

After 80:29 add:

	The service name string in the argument array is a pointer
	to a NULL terminated string containing "value-to-sym".
