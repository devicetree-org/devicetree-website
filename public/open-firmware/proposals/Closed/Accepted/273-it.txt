Subject: Item #273: Editorial changes to PCI binding

P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:273 Ver 1.0

Title:          Editorial changes to PCI binding

Author:         Jordan Brown

Date:           May 31 1995

Ed/Tech:        Editorial

Synopsis:       A few typos.

Doc & Version:  PCI binding 1.5

Problem:        A few typos.

Proposal:       

On Page 3, under "Memory Space", there's a paragraph that begins "And
encoding of the base ...".  That sentence just doesn't make sense.  I
think it can be fixed by changing "And" to "The".

On page 14, under "assigned-addresses", in the paragraph starting "The
values reported in ...", the word "resource" is spelled "resourcs".
