P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #377 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          Add internal (dummy) node definition 

Author:         John Kingman 

Date:           July 22, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       The "internal" node is intended to be a place to 
                identify hardware registers which do not otherwise
                belong to a recognized device.

Doc & Version:  CHRP System binding, Revision 1.5

Problem:        Platforms may have hardware registers for devices 
                known only to firmware and not intended for 
                operating system use. 

Proposal:       

Add a subsection (e.g., 5.9) to Section 5 of the CHRP System binding
named "Internal Nodes." 

This subsection defines an internal node as a node with the name 
"internal" which may only have a reg property which allocates bus 
addresses (on the bus of which it is a child) which are not intended 
for operating system use. 

(I chose "internal" instead of "reserved" to avoid confusion with the 
"reserved" property of the PHB.)

"name" 

    Standard property name, shall be "internal."

"reg" 

    Standard property name to reserve registers used internally
    by the platform on the parent bus to which this node is a child.
