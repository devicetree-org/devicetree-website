Subject: Item #242: PCI Binding - assigned-addresses clarification

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #242 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          "assigned-addresses" clarification

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           March 1, 1995

Ed/Tech:        Editorial

Synopsis:       clarify what happens when address allocation fails

Doc & Version:  PowerPC Binding 1.4

Problem: The current document does not mention what happens if address
space can not be assigned for some resource.

Proposal:

Add the following text under the description of the "assigned-addresses"
property underneath the note:

    The values reported in "assigned-addresses" represent the physical
    addresses that have been assigned.  If Open Firmware can not assign
    address space for a resource (e.g., the address space has been
    exhausted), that resource will not have an entry in the
    "assigned-addresses" property.

    Note: if no resources were assigned address space, the
    "assigned-addresses" property will have a null prop-encoded-array.
