Subject: Item #293: PCI bus master capable property (revised)

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #293 Ver 1.1

Title:		PCI bus master capable property

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		Oct 4, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	no mechanism exists to determine bus mastering capabilities

Doc & Version:	PCI Bus Binding to IEEE1275-1994 Rev 1.5 Draft

Problem:	A PCI device driver cannot tell whether bus mastering is available

Proposal:	

	Add in the Bus-specific properties for Bus Nodes (page 11) after
"slot-names" (lines 35-43):

	"bus-master-capable"

		prop-name, describes whether the device is wired to be
		PCI bus master capable.

		prop-encoded-array:  An integer, encoded as with encode-int.
		The property value is a bitmask indicating whether the
		device is wired to be bus master capable.  The bit being set
		implies that the device is so wired and the bit being reset
		implies that the device is not so wired.  The least significant
		bit corresponds to Device Number 0, the next bit corresponds
		to Device Number 1, etc.

(note: Mitch has suggested that the property be named "slave-only" and that
       the bit values have the inverse meaning.  Apparently there is some
       history to this name of which I am unaware.  Mitch could you enlighten
       us?  It seems to me that the name "bus-master-capable" is more easily
       associated with the PCI command bit "Bus Master" [as named in the PCI
       specification rev 2.1])
