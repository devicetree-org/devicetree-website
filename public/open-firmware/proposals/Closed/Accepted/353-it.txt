Subject: Item #353: PCI Binding ROM Image format

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #353 Ver 0

Title:		Misleading description of PCI ROM Image format

Author:		Mitch Bradley

Date:		April 26, 1996

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	Bogus wording in PCI rom header description

Doc & Version:	PCI Bus Binding 1.65  (the problem exists in many versions)

Problem:	See below

Proposal:	

Section 9. ROM Image Format for FCode   says:

	38h - FFFFh  The PCI Data Structure (PCI spec 6.3.1.2), Vital Product
		     Data, and FCode program can each begin anywhere within
		     this range, in any order. ...

It should say:

	38h - FFFFh  The Vital Product Data and FCode program can each begin
		     anywhere within this range, in any order. ...

The PCI Data Structure starts at offset 1Ah, so it cannot also appear in the
range 38h - FFFFh.

I suspect that this problem arose when we decided to pin down the location
of the PCI Data Structure rather than letting it be anywhere, and then forgot
to delete the reference to it in the floating area.
