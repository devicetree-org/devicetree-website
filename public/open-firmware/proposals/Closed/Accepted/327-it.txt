Title: Need for a "latency-timer" Standard PCI Configuration Property

Author: Tom Caron

Date: 1/26/96

Ed/Tech: Technical

Synopsis: probe-pci should create a "latency-timer" property

Doc & Version: PCI Bus Binding to IEEE Std 1275-1994 Standard for Boot Firmware
	Revision 1.6

Problem:

    The current bindings use the existance of certain standard PCI
    configuration properties to indicate that various features of
    a function have been enabled.  The "fast-back-to-back" property
    described in section 4.1.2.1 is an example of this usage.
    A property should be added to indicate the setting of the
    Latency Timer register for devices that implement this register.

Proposal:

    Add the following entry to the list of properties in section 4.1.2.1.

	"latency-timer"

	   This property shall be present if the function's latency timer
	   register is set to a non zero value and shall be absent otherwise.

    Add the following entry to list of properties created by the "probe-pci"
    command.  This can be found in section 5, beginning on line 42.

	"latency-timer"
