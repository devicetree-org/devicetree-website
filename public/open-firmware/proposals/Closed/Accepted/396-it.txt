Subject: Item #396: Improve max-transfer example.

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #396 Ver 1.0

Title:		Improve max-transfer example.

Author:		Michael Perry

Date:		1996 Nov 15

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Fix scsi example usage of max-transfer.

Doc & Version:	IEEE Std 1275-1994

Problem:	The definition of max-transfer requires it to be
	rounded down to a multiple of block-size. The sample scsi 
	driver in Annex E sets max-transfer to h# 7f.ffff. Block-size
	is generally a power of two, often 512 bytes.
	

Proposal:	Change the value of max-transfer in Annex E to
	h# 80.0000 which is a power of two.

: max-transfer   ( -- n )
   " max-transfer" ['] $call-parent catch if  2drop h# 80.0000  then
;
