Subject: Item #223: Create "Device Extensions to IEEE 1275" document

P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:223 Ver <Author-Version#>

Title:          Create "Device Extensions to IEEE 1275" document

Author:         Jordan Brown

Date:           26 January 1995

Ed/Tech:        Editorial

Synposis:       Extract text from PowerPC and put into a generic doc

Doc & Version:  New document

Problem:

Demand has been seen for specifications for devices in addition to
those in the core document, and for enhancements to the specifications
in the core document.

Proposal:       

Therefore, proposed that a new document be created titled "Device
Extensions to IEEE 1275", containing:

	. The "Multi-color text" extension, by Mitch Bradley and
	  Ron Hochsprung.
	. The "Graphics device" extension, by Mitch Bradley and
	  Ron Hochsprung.
	(Note:  The above extensions are derived from the PowerPC
	binding of 10/06/94, removed from that binding on 01/25/95.
	They were collectively described in a document entitled
	"Multi-color text".)

	. From the PowerPC processor binding:
	. . Section 12.2 "Keyboard devices"
	. . Section 12.3 "Pointing devices"
	. . Section 12.4 "Real Time Clock (RTC) Device"
	. . Section 12.5 "Sound Device"
	. . Section 12.6 "NVRAM Device"
	. . Section 12.7 "Parallel port device"
