P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #376 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          Add nvram property to /chosen

Author:         John Kingman

Date:           July 22, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       The nvram property is added to the /chosen node
                to indicate which NVRAM is the CHRP NVRAM.

Doc & Version:  CHRP System binding, Revision 1.5 

Problem:        On a system with more than one NVRAM device node,
                it is not clear which one is the CHRP NVRAM.  

Proposal:       

Add a subsection (e.g., 5.9) to Section 5 of the CHRP System binding
named "Chosen Node." 

In this subsection list the property "nvram" as required under the
/chosen node with the following text (in the manner of section 3.5 
of the core document):

 Property Name  Encoding  Value
 -------------  --------  -------------------------------------
 nvram          int       Ihandle for the package that firmware
                          is currently using for NVRAM.  This
                          package must include a size method,
                          as described in the Device Support
                          Extensions document.
