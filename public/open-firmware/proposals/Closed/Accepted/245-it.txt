P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #245 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          extended Standard Font definition

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           March 2, 1995

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       define an extension to standard font mechanism

Doc & Version:  IEEE Std 1275-1994

Problem:        Some Client Programs (e.g., NT) assume a richer font than
                basic fonts typically used.

Proposal:

In the next revision of 1275 and/or any appropriate means to publish this to
a wide audience sooner, add the following.

on page 197:
change line 25
from:   "Set *char-height* to height ..."
to:     "Set *char-height* to absolute-value of height ..."

replace lines 35,36 on page 197 with

    If height > 0, then *char-height* is one greater than the number of
    scan line images in the font.  I.e., an implicit blank scan line is assumed
    for the font.

    If height < 0, then *char-height* is the absolute value of height
    and there are no implicit blank scan lines between character rows.  I.e.,
    any spacing between character rows must be explicitly present in the font
    by including scan line images of zeros.

    Note: height < 0 allows representing fonts that have contiguous vertical
    images (e.g., vertical lines) without any blank space between them.

>> One problem with this.  How does this information get communicated to a
>> display driver that needs to take over DRAW-CHARACTER?
