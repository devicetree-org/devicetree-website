Subject: Item #288: Device Supplement: new property for wide SCSI


P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #288 Ver 1

Title:		New property for wide SCSI

Author:		Lilian Walter

Date:		Sept 15, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical.

Synopsis:	Add new property for wide SCSI

Doc & Version:	Device Support Extensions to Open Firmware,
		Core Errata

Problem:

Currently, software (such as client programs and show-children)  
cannot easily determine from the device tree whether the SCSI  
controller is wide or narrow.  Software needs to know this piece of  
information because it should not try to probe SCSI id beyond 7 with  
a narrow SCSI controller.  Doing so will probe SCSI devices twice.

Proposal:	

Add to Device Support Extensions to Open Firmware:

Section 9.1	Properties for Bus Nodes

"wide"
	The presence of this property denotes that the SCSI  
controller represented by this node is wide, with SCSI id ranges 0  
through 15.

Add to Core Errata:

E.6.3	hacom.fth

....

: show-children  ( -- )
  open  0=  if  ." Can't open SCSI host adapter" cr  exit  then

  " wide"  get-my-property  if  8  else  2drop d# 16  then
  0 do
     i probe-target  if
        ." Target " i . cr
        8 0  do  i j show-lun  loop
     then
  loop
;
