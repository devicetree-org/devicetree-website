P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:330 Ver 
Title: 	Additional properties available for Secondary Cache Nodes (L2)
Author:         Bill Rees, FirePower Systems Inc
Date:           March 24, 1996
Ed/Tech:        Technical
Synopsis:       Additional L2 hardware description required to identify L2
		as inline or not.
Doc & Version:
Problem:

	  The problem is the ambiguity of the L2 description with respect to
	  function.  Given a piece of software that is trying to describe the
	  system to an OS, an L2 cache may reside in an OS tree either as a
	  peer to memory in the case of a look-aside cache, or as a child of
	  CPU in the case of an in-line cache.

	  The cache node descriptions do not currently provide enough
	  property info to determine whether the cache node describes a
	  look-aside or an in-line cache..

Proposal:

	Proposal is to allow an additional property, cache-inline, to
	describe those secondary caches that physically lie between the cpu
	and the system bus.
	
	The absence of this property would indicate a look-aside cache
	which sits on the memory bus and functions in parallel with
	memory.
