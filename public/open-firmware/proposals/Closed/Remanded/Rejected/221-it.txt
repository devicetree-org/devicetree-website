Subject: Item #221: Eliminate "cpu-version" from PPC binding

P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:221 Ver 1.0

Title:          Eliminate "cpu-version" from PPC binding

Author:         Jordan Brown

Date:           26 January 1995

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Eliminate "cpu-version" because "name" contains the info

Doc & Version:  PowerPC binding dated 10/06/94

Problem:

As the "name" property is now defined to include the CPU model number
(eg 601, 603, 617), the "cpu_version" property is now superfluous.

Proposal:       

Therefore, proposed that in section 5.2 at 21, the "cpu-version"
property description be deleted.
