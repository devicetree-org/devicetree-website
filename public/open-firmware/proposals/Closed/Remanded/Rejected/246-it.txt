Subject: Item #246: PowerPC binding - std default font

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #246 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          PowerPC standard default-font

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           March 2, 1995

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       define the default-font for PowerPC binding

Doc & Version:  PowerPC binding

Problem:        Some Client Programs (e.g., NT) assume a richer font than
                basic fonts typically used.

Proposal:

add a section that describes the standard font to be used by PowerPC
implementations of Open Firmware.  I.e., the font that is defined by
*default-font*.  This would include, at least, the standard font that NT
assumes.  The more general one would be the "DOS standard font", with the
exception of the h# 9B character that is used as a short-hand for the ESC-[
sequence.
