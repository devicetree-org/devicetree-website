Subject: Item #262: PowerPC devices

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #262 Ver 1.0

Title:		PowerPC device methods/properties need small mods

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 21, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Editorial & Technical

Synopsis:	Several minor issues w.r.t. PowerPC devices

Doc & Version:	PowerPC processor binding to OpenFirmware Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	Various PowerPC devices need clarification/changes/wordsmithing

Proposal:	
		1) Section 11.2.3 page 22 line 33:

		Change "key sequence shall cause" to "key sequence may cause"

		[I don't believe that there is a requirement to *have* a break
		 sequence].


		2) Section 11.3.2 page 23 line 13:

		"The least significant bit corresponds to the left-most
		 button of the device."

		Drop this.  It is not in general possible to tell which
		button is on the left or even if there is a left-most button.


		3) Section 11.8 page 26 and page 27

		 i) Move this to ISA and SCSI bindings

		ii) but... should "8042" be "i8042" or "INTC,8042"?

		    floppy shouldn't this be :
			fdc (floppy controller)
			  floppy@0
			  floppy@1 (or fd@0 and fd@1)

		   timer... no methods or properties defined for this device!

		   ide: like floppy

		   ide
			ide-disk@0
		 	ide-disk@1 (or whatever the ide binding says)

		   nvram and rtc previous version implied the NS1385.  Are
		   we better off with:

		   NS,nvram-1385 and NS,rtc-1385?


		   is the scsi device_type "scsi" or "scsi-2"?


		iii) Also section 11.8 page 26 line 51:

		    Suggest changing "super I/O chip must not be created" to
			"supert I/O chip may not be created". And changing
			lines 52 and 53 to "If the super I/O chip is not
			created as a node then the device nodes of the..."

		4) Section 11.9 page 26

			com1 and com2 are not well-defined.  Are these
			any "serial" device_type devices?  Are they
			explicitly RS-232?  RS-422?  Does the "1" and "2"
			in the name imply anything w.r.t. ordering/preference?


			"floppy" - is this the floppy drive or the controller?
