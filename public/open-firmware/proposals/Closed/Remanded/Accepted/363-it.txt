P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #363 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          PowerPC Processor properties 

Author:         John Kingman

Date:           June 11, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Power PC architecture V 1.08 changes reflected in properties

Doc & Version:  PowerPC Processor Binding Revision: 1.10 DRAFT 

Problem:        PowerPC Processor architecture deltas need to be reflected

Proposal:       

I.  Stfiwx

    Revision 1.08 of the PowerPC architecture phases stfiwx into the base
    architecture.  This instruction had been part of the graphics group of
    instructions.  The 601 was the only PowerPC processor that did not
    implement stfiwx.

    Changes:  Page 15, lines 44 and 45, delete "stfiwx" from these lines.

II. 64-bit Virtual Address

    Some 64-bit PowerPC implementations will not support the full 80-bit
    virtual address defined by the PowerPC architecture, so a 64-bit subset 
    is being added to the PowerPC architecture.

    Add:  Page 14, following line 47:

      "64-bit-virtual-address"

      prop-encoded-array: <none>

      This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC microprocessor 
      defined by this CPU node supports the 64-bit virtual address subset 
      of the 80-bit virtual address as defined by the PowerPC architecture.  
      The absence of this property indicates that the PowerPC 
      microprocessor defined by this CPU node supports the full 80-bit 
      virtual address defined by the PowerPC architecture.  This property
      is only valid for 64-bit implementations.
