Subject: Item #222: Split PowerPC binding into processor and platform bindings

P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:222 Ver 1.0

Title:          Split PowerPC binding into processor and platform bindings

Author:         Jordan Brown

Date:           26 January 1995

Ed/Tech:        Editorial

Synopsis:       Split PowerPC binding into processor and platform bindings

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor binding dated 10/06/94

Problem:

There appears general concensus that the existing PowerPC binding
document exceeds the scope of a processor binding and should be
split into a processor binding for PowerPC and a platform binding
for PReP.

Proposal:       

Therefore, proposed that the following sections be moved out of
the PowerPC processor binding and into a new PReP binding:

	. Section 1 "Overview":
	  Move the last sentence of the third paragraph, starting "Since
	  the minimum ..."
	. Section 1.1 "Endian-ness Support"
	. Section 1.2 "Bi-Endian Booting"
	. Section 2.1 "References":
	  Move [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11].
	. Section 2.2, "Terms":
	  Move the definitions of "ELF", "FDISK", "PE".
	  Copy the definitions of "core", "Open Firmware",
	  "Real-Mode", and "Virtual-Mode".
	. Section 4 "Packages"
	. Section 5.1 "Root node properties"
	. Section 5.5 "/openprom node property"
	. Section 8.1 "Client Program Format"
	. Section 8.7 "Halt callback"
	. Section 9.??? regarding Ctrl-Break (added at 01/25/95 meeting)
	. Section 10 "Configuration Variables":
	  Move "little-endian?".
	. Section 12 "Extensions for PowerPC based systems"
	  (Note that section 12.1 was removed to a separate document
	  on 01/25/95.)
