Subject: Item #281: PReP binding 0.02 halt-address clarification

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #281 Ver 1.0

Title:		Clarification of "halt-address" calling requirements

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		Aug 11, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	Requiring disabling of virtual translations is not clear

Doc & Version:	PowerPC Reference Platform binding to IEEE Std 1275-1994 (0.02)

Problem:	The wording is currently "murky"

Proposal:	

Change the 2nd sentence staring on page 5 line 48 from:
"The client program must establish the real mode address translation for
the firmware."
to:
"The client program must disable both instruction and data virtual address
translations prior to executing the halt callback."
