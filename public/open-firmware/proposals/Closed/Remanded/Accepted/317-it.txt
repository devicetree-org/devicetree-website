P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #317 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          PowerPC processor binding update

Author:         John A. Kingman

Date:           February 27, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Incorporate updates resulting from various reviews

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor Binding 1.9 DRAFT

Problem:        Current binding needs to be updated to reflect additional
                editorial and structural changes resulting from additional
                reviews relating to the PowerPC Common Hardware Reference 
                Platform (CHRP).

Proposal:

                Key:  E -- editorial change
                      P -- move to platform (PReP/CHRP) binding
                      C -- resulting from CHRP review
                      S -- clarification

                Note: This proposal supercedes #315.  Lines with "|" in the
                      first column are changed from proposal #315.

K Pg Lines Description of change
- -- ----- ---------------------------------------------------------------

S 10    3  Replace "either the real-base or virt-base values equal to -1"
           with "real-base equal to -1 and real-mode? true, or virt-base
           equal to -1 and real-mode? false"
           
|       8  Add "Clients can minimize this exposure by setting the size to
|          -1 and allowing Open Firmware to choose the size."

C 11 24-27 Replace paragraph with the following:

|          "The client program must use the Open Firmware claim client 
|           interface service to allocate physical memory while physical 
|           memory is managed by Open Firmware.  Physical memory shall 
|           remain managed by Open Firmware until the client program defines 
|           the real-mode physical memory management assist callbacks.  
|           Physical memory must be managed by the client program once the 
|           client program defines the real-mode physical memory management 
|           assist callbacks.  Open Firmware shall use the client program's 
|           real-mode physical memory management assist callbacks to allocate 
|           physical memory after the client program has assumed physical 
|           memory management."

E 13 27-29 Change "unit-number" to "unit-address"

C 16    2  Add the following properties:

           "tlb-split"

              This property, if present, indicates that the TLB has a 
              split organization. Absence of this property indicates 
              that the TLB has a unified organization.

           "d-tlb-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the total number of d-TLB entries.

           "d-tlb-sets"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the number of associativity sets of the d-TLB. 
              A value of 1 indicates that the d-TLB is fully-associative.

           "i-tlb-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the total number of i-TLB entries.

           "i-tlb-sets"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the number of associativity sets of the i-TLB. 
              A value of 1 indicates that the i-TLB is fully-associative.

C 16   39  Add the following properties and note:

           "i-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the internal instruction cache's line size, 
              in bytes, if different than its block size.

           "d-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents the internal data cache's line size, 
              in bytes, if different than its block size.

           Note: If this is a unified cache, the corresponding i- and
           d- sizes must be equal.

C 17   39  Add the following properties and note:

           "i-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents this instruction cache's line size, 
              in bytes, if different than its block size.

           "d-cache-line-size"

              Standard property, encoded as with encode-int, that 
              represents this data cache's line size, in bytes, if 
              different than its block size.

           Note: If this is a unified cache, the corresponding i- and
           d- sizes must be equal.

C 18   32  Add the following to Table 1:

           |--------------|---------------------------------------|------|
           |%sr0-%sr15    | preserved by client interface         |      |
           |--------------|---------------------------------------|------|

P 19  8-15 Copy to the platform bindings and replace the 3rd and 4th sentences
           with the following:

           "All of physical memory from load-base to either the start of
            Open Firmware physical memory or the end of physical memory,
            whichever comes first, shall be available for loading the 
            client program."

C 20   43  Add the following sentences:

           "All caches shall be consistent with memory and with each other
            when control is passed to the client program.  Also, consistency
            shall be maintained whenever control is temporarily passed back 
            to Open Firmware by the client."

S 22   30  Add the following sentences:

          "%sr0 through %sr15

               Access saved copies of segment registers."

S 22 52-54 Move to follow line 12
