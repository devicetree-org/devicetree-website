Subject: Item #301: 8042 device binding

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #301 Ver 1.0

Title:		8042 device binding

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		Dec 12, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	There exists no 8042 device binding

Doc & Version:	Device extensions?  (Really a new document)

Problem:	There is no specification for the 8042 and children

Proposal:	
		For the 8042 itself (which is an interior node)

		Additional Properties:

		"device_type"		"8042"
		"#address-cells"	1
		"#size-cells"		0

		Additional Methods:

		encode-unit
		decode-unit

		Numeric representation of unit addresses:

		Prop encoded int whose value is either 0 (for the main port)
		or 1 (for the aux port).

		Text representation of unit addresses:

		"main" for the main port and "aux" for the aux port.

		Note: it is possible to have either two keyboard or two
		mice connected or reverse the mouse and keyboard plugs.

		Additional requirements:

		Open Firmware shall initialize and utilize the keyboard
		and the keyboard controller in the default or power-up
		mode(s).  This avoids surprises to the OS and also causes
		Open Firmware to function correctly in the event that
		the keyboard is unplugged and replugged after startup.
