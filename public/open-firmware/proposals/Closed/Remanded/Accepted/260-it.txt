Subject: Item #260: PPC load address could be clearer

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #260 Ver 1.0

Title:		Clarification of the meaning of "load-base"

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 21, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	"load-base" should be clearly identified as a physical address

Doc & Version:	PowerPC processor binding to OpenFirmware Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	It is unclear from the wording that "load-base" is a physical
		address.

Proposal:	In section 8.2 page 15 add:

		"load-base" is a physical address.

		Further at lines 25 and 26 where it states:

		"At least 4MB of memory shall be available at that address."

		perhaps add:

		"This allows a client program of up to 4MB to be loaded and/or
		 allows the client program to grow to up to 4MB."
