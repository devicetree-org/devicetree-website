Subject: Item #282: PowerPC default mapping mode

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #282 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:		Default mapping mode

Author:		Mitch Bradley

Date:		8/14/95

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Establish address-dependent default value for "mode" argument

Doc & Version:	PowerPC Binding, Rev. 1.03

Problem:	I think that the PowerPC binding should say more about the
default value of the "mode" argument to MMU "map" and "modify" methods.

Proposal:	

Add the following sentence to the end of clause 5.1:

The default mode (i.e. the mode specified by the value "-1" for the "mode"
argument is -1) for the MMU package's "map-in" and "modify" methods shall
be appropriate for memory if the beginning of the physical address range
affected by the operation refers to system memory, and appropriate for I/O
devices otherwise.
