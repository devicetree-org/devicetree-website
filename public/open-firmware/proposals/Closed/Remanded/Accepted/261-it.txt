Subject: Item #261: PPC translate client callback return values are incorrect

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #261 Ver 1.0

Title:		translate callback return values are incorrect

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 21, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	The translate callback should return a 32-bit physical address

Doc & Version:	PowerPC processor binding to OpenFirmware Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	The translate return values have a real.hi and real.lo

Proposal:	In section 8.6.2 page 18 line 9 the "out" return values state:

		OUT: error, [address] real.hi, [address] real.lo, mode

		but this binding specifies that #size-cells for the CPU
		(mmu) is 1 thus only 32-bits.  This appears to be an oversight.

		Suggest:

		OUT: error, [address] real, mode
