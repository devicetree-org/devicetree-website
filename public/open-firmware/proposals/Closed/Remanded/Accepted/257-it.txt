Subject: Item #257: PPC BOOTP extensions not specified

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #257 Ver 1,0

Title:		BOOTP packet needs more specification

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 21, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	BOOTP needs to be specific w.r.t. extensions

Doc & Version:	PowerPC processor binding to OpenFirmware Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	obp-tftp support package isn't clear w.r.t. BOOTP extensions

Proposal:	On page 9 line 52 add:

		"No vendor extensions to BOOTP shall be utilized."

		[ed. This can revisited later.  Perhaps even a look into DHCP
		 would be useful in later revisions.]
