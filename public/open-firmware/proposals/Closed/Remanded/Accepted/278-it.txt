Title:          new PowerPC processor binding properties -- 
                "603-translation", and "603-power-management"

Synopsis:       add new properties ("603-translation", and 
                "603-power-management") to CPU nodes

Doc & Version:  PowerPC processor Binding 1.02 

Problem:        Current binding does not identify processors with 603 style 
                capabilities and operating systems should not have to rely
                on specific model numbers to determine this.

Proposal:       

Add the following words to the section: "CPU node properties"

"603-translation"
    This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC microprocessor 
    (defined by this CPU node) uses the PowerPC 603 defined mechanism 
    to update its Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs).  The absence of this 
    property indicates that the PowerPC microprocessor (defined by this CPU 
    node) does not use the PowerPC 603 defined mechanism to update its TLBs.

"603-power-management"
    This property, if present, indicates that the PowerPC microprocessor 
    (defined by this CPU node) implements the PowerPC 603 defined power 
    management states.  The absence of this property indicates that the 
    PowerPC microprocessor (defined by this CPU node) does not support the 
    PowerPC 603 defined power management states.

Rationale:

The 603 family uses a software translation mechanism to update its TLBs, 
whereas the other members of the PowerPC family implement this function in 
hardware.  The 603 family also implements a set of power management states 
which are not described in the PowerPC Architecture, and which are different
than the support provided by the other members of the PowerPC family.
These properties will allow an operating system to support future PowerPC 603 
family microprocessors without having to know the microprocessor's specific 
model number in advance.
