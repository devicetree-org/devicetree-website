Subject: Item #298: DS1385 binding

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #298 Ver 1.0

Title:		NVRAM device binding (Dallas Semiconductor 1385)

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		Oct 30, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	Device specific binding for an NVRAM device

Doc & Version:	New binding

Problem:	There is no specification for the register of a NVRAM device

Proposal:	Define device specific properties for the Dallas Semi 1385


		"name"
			Standard Open Firmware property; the value of this
			property shall follow the standard rules for Open
			Firmware device names. (i.e. "nvram")

		"compatible"
			Standard Open Firmware property; the value of this
			property shall start with "DS,1385" .

		"device_type"
			Standard Open Firmware property; the value of this
			property shall be "nvram"

		"reg"
			Standard Open Firmware property; the value of this
			property shall follow the standard rules of Open
			Firmware devices (i.e. the format of the bus by
			which this device may be addressed - ISA bus)

			The first tuple shall define the address of the
			least significant byte of the ISA I/O address port

			The second tuple shall define the address off the
			most significant byte of the ISA I/O address port

			The third tuple shalle define the address of the
			ISA I/O data port.

Example (follows PR*P reference implementation):

"name"		"nvram"
"device_type"	"nvram"
"compatible"	"DS,1385"
"reg"		0x1, 0x74, 0x1 (prop encoded ints)
		0x1, 0x75, 0x1
		0x1, 0x77, 0x1
