Subject: Item #259: PowerPC client program formats are specified too broadly

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #259 Ver 1.0

Title:		Limitations on client program formats

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		March 21, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	The client program format is too broad

Doc & Version:	PowerPC processor binding to OpenFirmware Draft 1.0 2/16/95

Problem:	The specification for ELF binaries is overly broad

Proposal:	In section 8.1 page 14 after lines 23-25:

		An ELF client program shall consist of two segments:
		a text segment (read/execute) and a data segment
		(read/write/execute).  Only the data segment may
		have a memory size greater than the file size (implied "bss").
		Further, to ease the problem of mapping the image for
		Virtual mode.  The page offsets within memory shall equal
		the page offsets within the file.  The definition of
		"page offset" is those bits of an address which is below
		the granularity of memory allocation or mapping.
		(i.e. page size of 4K implies page offset mask of 4K - 1)
