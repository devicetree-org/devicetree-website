P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #361 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          Add "reserved-interrupts" property to isa-pic node

Author:         John Kingman

Date:           June 11, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       use "reserved-interrupts" to indicate unusable interrupts

Doc & Version:  CHRP ISA Interrupt Controller Device Binding Version 1.0

Problem:        The isa-pic node is using "interrupts" to indicate 
                unusable interrupts, which is not the intent of the 
                "interrupts" property.

Proposal:       Add a new property "reserved-interrupts" which shall be
                a list of IRQs which cannot be assigned due to cascading, 
                wiring, or other reasons.  

                On page 4, line 30 change "interrupts" to 
                "reserved-interrupts" and delete the first two sentences 
                starting at line 34.
