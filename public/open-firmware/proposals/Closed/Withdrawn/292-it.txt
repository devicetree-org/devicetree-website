Subject: Item #292: PCI bus-master-capable property

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #292 Ver 1.0

Title:		PCI bus master capable property

Author:		Brian.Horn@west.sun.com

Date:		Oct 4, 1995

Ed/Tech:	Technical

Synopsis:	no mechanism exists to determine bus mastering capabilities

Doc & Version:	PCI Bus Binding to IEEE1275-1994 Rev 1.5 Draft

Problem:	A PCI device driver cannot tell whether bus mastering is available

Proposal:	

	Add in the Bus-specific properties for Bus Nodes (page 11) after
"slot-names" (lines 35-43):

	"bus-master-capable"

		prop-name, describes whether the device is wired to be
		PCI bus master capable.

		prop-encoded-array:  An integer, encoded as with encode-int.
		The property value is a bitmask indicating whether the
		device is PCI bus master capable.  The bit being set implies
		that the device is capable and the bit being reset implies
		that the device is not capable.  The least significant bit
		corresponds to Device Number 0, the next bit corresponds
		to Device Number 1, etc.
