P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:352 Ver 1

Title:          1275 Bindings for SCSI-3

Author:         Paul Thomas

Date:           April 26, 1986

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       This proposal supersedes proposal 333.  A new draft of the
		content for a SCSI-3 binding is presented.  Proposal 333
		is withdrawn.

Doc & Version:  SCSI-3 Binding

Problem:        

There is interest in developing a document for the bindings between SCSI-3
and 1275.


Proposal:       

The following is the content of a standard binding SCSI-3 (ANS X3.270:1996)
to 1275.  The boilerplate is missing.  This proposal includes language for
SBP physical implementations of SCSI-3.  This proposal includes editorial
changes.

1.  Physical address formats and representations

SCSI-3 devices are addressed with one 64-bit "target" identifier and one
64-bit "logical unit" identifier.

The text representation of a scsi-3 bus physical address is "target,lun".
Each of "target" and "lun" is a string of characters composed of lower case
hexadecimal digits, with leading zeros deleted.

The numerical representation of a scsi-3 bus physical address consists of the
most significant 32 bits of the target identifier in the high number, the
least significant 32 bits of the target identifier in the next position, the
most significant 32 bits of the logical unit identifier third, and the least
significant 32 bits of the logical unit identifier in the low number.

The significance of the bits in the target identifiers and the bits in the
logical unit identifiers is determined by a combination of the particular
scsi-3 device and the particular scsi-3 target identified by the target
identifiers:

   In the case where the physical implementation of the scsi-3 device complies
	with ANS X3.272:1996 Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL), the target
	identifier is the 64 bit world-wide-name of the target.  The 64 bits
	of the logical unit identifier are interpreted by the target.

   In the case where the physical implementation of the scsi-3 device complies
	with ANS X3T10/855D SCSI-3 Parallel Interface (SPI), the target
	identifier is the 5-bit target id embedded as the low bits of the
	64-bit identifier, with more significant bits all zero.  The logical
	unit identifier is the same as the SPI logical unit number.

   In the case where the physical implementation of the scsi-3 device complies
	with ANS X3.269-1996 Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI (FCP), the target
	identifier is the 64 bit world-wide-name.  The 64 bits of the logical
	unit identifier are interpreted by the target.

   In the case where the physical implementation of the scsi-3 device complies
	with ANS X3T10/992D Information Technology - SCSI-3 Serial Bus Protocol
	(SBP), the target identifier is the 64 bit world-wide-name constructed
	from the information in the configuration ROM.  The logical unit
	identifier is the same as the SBP logical unit number.

2.  Properties

These properties are required for all devices with a value of "scsi-3" for
the "device_type" property (scsi-3 host adaptors):

   device_type		scsi-3
   #address-cells	4
   scsi3-id		byte array, 8 bytes in size


These properties are required when the physical implementation complies with
SPI if the device is differential or capable of 16 bit parallel data transfers:

   wide
   differential


   scsi-initiator-id	integer
   wwn			byte array, 8 bytes in size
   local-wwn		byte array, 8 bytes in size

If the physical implementation is SPI, scsi-initiator-id is required.  If
the physical implementation is FC-AL, FCP, or SBP, wwn is required.  If wwn
is derived via the mac-address/local-mac-address interaction, and the device
has a local world-wide-name, local-wwn is required. (See [1],
"local-mac-address", mac-address, "mac-address", and "network".)

In either case, scsi3-id is required.  If scsi-initiator-id exists, scsi3-id
is the same with the integer embedded in the least significant bits of the
byte array.  If wwn exists, scsi3-id is the same as wwn.


3.  Methods

These methods are required (descriptions as per the current descriptions for
SCSI-2 where not given here) (see [1] and [2] for the current descriptions):

   close  ( -- )

   decode-unit  ( addr len -- lunlo lunhi targetlo targethi )

   diagnose  ( -- error-code | 0 )

   dma-alloc  ( ...size -- virt )

   dma-free  ( virt size -- )

   encode-unit  ( lunlo lunhi targetlo targethi -- addr len )

   execute-command  ( buf-addr,len dir cmd-addr,len -- hw-err? | statbyte 0 )

   max-transfer  ( -- n )

   no-data-command  ( cmd-addr -- error? )

   open  ( -- okay? )

	If the physical implementation is SPI, the interaction with
	inherited scsi-initiator-id is required (See [2], 9.2 open).
	If the physical implementation is FC-AL, FCP, or SBP, and the wwn for
	the device is derived via the mac-address/local-mac-address
	interaction, then the wwn for the device must be checked when open
	executes (See [1], "local-mac-address", mac-address, "mac-address",
	and "network".)

   retry-command  ( buf-addr,len dir cmd-addr,len #retries -- 
					0 | hw-err? stat | sensebuf 0 stat )

   set-responder  ( unit-addr,len target-addr,len -- )

	Unit-addr,len is an array of bytes in the same format as the property
	"wwn", containing the desired logical unit identifier.
	Target-addr,len is a similar array of bytes for the desired target
	identifier.

[Note: set-responder replaces set-address from the scsi-2 set of methods.]

   set-timeout  ( msecs -- )

   short-data-command  ( data-len cmd-addr,len -- error? | data-addr 0 )

   translate-address  ( unit1-addr,len target1-addr,len --
				unit2-addr,len target2-addr,len ok? )

	Unit1-addr,len is an array of bytes in the same format as the property
	"wwn", containing the desired logical unit identifier.
	Target1-addr,len is similar for the desired target identifier.

	If a successful translation is made, 
	     1	ok? is true,
	     2	unit2-addr,len is an array of bytes containing a binary
		representation of the desired logical unit identifier as
		translated for use inside a scsi-3 command block in the
		current physical implementation, and
	     3  target2-addr,len is a similar translation for the desired
		target identifier for the current physical implementation.

	If a successful translation is not made,
	     1	ok? is false, and
	     2	unit2-addr,len and target2-addr,len are stack items with no
		specified bit patterns or meanings.

[Note: translate-address may not be required.  It would be used by commands
 such as copy that need to know the wwn in order to include it in their
 command packet or data.]


This method is optional:

   show-children  ( -- )
