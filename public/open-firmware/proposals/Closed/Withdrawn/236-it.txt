Subject: Item #236: Change "reg" prop names in PCI binding

Title:          Conformance of "reg" property for PCI binding

Author:         Brian Horn

Date:           Feb. 26, 1995

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       Change names of two "reg" like properties

Doc & Version:  PCI binding to 1275 version 1.4

Problem:        The "reg" property has different base semantics other bindings

Proposal:       At the moment there is described two properties that
		have "reg"-like semantics.  One is "reg" and the other
		is "assigned-adresses".  However, the "reg" property is being
		used at the device driver interface level as a request
		to the base 1275 code for where the device would like to
		"live".  The "assigned-adresses" is where the 1275 finally
		configures the device to actually "live".  All the other
		bindings have the semantics of the "reg" property
		being where the device actually does "live".  To have
		the PCI devices work differently is awkward and surprising.
		Suggestion: change the current "reg" property to be
		"requested-addresses" and change "assigned-adresses" to
		be "reg".  This preserves the current behaviour of the device
		"asks" the the base 1275 code selects, but brings PCI
		devices into line with the other bindings.
