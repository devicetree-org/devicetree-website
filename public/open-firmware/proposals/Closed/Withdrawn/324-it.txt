I have put a postscript version of the first pass of the 'Generic Names'
Recommended Practice, Version 1.0 Draft, Document to discuss at the next
Open Firmware Meeting on an IBM Server Machine.  This document may not be
added to 'playground' in time for the meeting next week, so the document can
be found at:

    ftp://ftp.austin.ibm.com/pub/OpenFirmware GNAMV10D.PS


John Kingman, under the agenda item for Recommended Practices; 'Generic
Names', I would recommend the following actions:

1) General review of document

2) As a group, collectively review the list of 'generic names' under
   Section Guideline 1, page 4.  Modify or add any new 'generic names'
   as required.

3) As a group, fill out the PCI Class Code Names in Table 1, last column,
   beginning on page 6.
