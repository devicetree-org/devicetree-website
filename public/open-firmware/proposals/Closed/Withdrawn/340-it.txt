Subject: Item #340: PCI Binding: add "latency-timer" property

P1275 Openboot Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #:340 Ver <Author-Version#>

Title:          new "latency-timer" property for PCI Binding

Author:         Ron Hochsprung

Date:           4/22/96

Ed/Tech:        Technical

Synopsis:       add new property ("latency-timer") to PCI Binding

Doc & Version:  PCI Binding 1.7

Problem:

We added a new property to report the value that was programmed into a
device's Cache Line Size register.  We discuss how the Latency Timer
is supposed to be set by the firmware, but we have no way of reporting
to what value it was set.

Proposal:

In the list of properties in section 4.1.2.1, add the following:

    "latency-timer"

       This property shall indicate the value to which the device's
       Latency Timer value was set.

Add this new property into the list of properties that get created by
*probe-pci*
in section 5.
