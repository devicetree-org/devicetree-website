        2 -- USB or 1394 Bus using SCSI-3 s/w conventions:
                - will have a node for the physical USB or 1394,
                  the SCSI-3 aspect is hidden
        - Motion to consider in 2 parts (MB):
             one for SPI phys bus, the
             other for the programming model.

PCI Binding Review Revision 1.75
    #366: (posting)
	Amendments:
            - p21, l24: replace bullet with
               "If the device's expansion ROM base address register
                indicates a non-zero size, an entry describing
                the expansion ROM constructed as for normal
                base address registers."
            - p8, l26-28 replace "Because..." with "Some PCI-PCI
                bridges restrict I/O address space to 16 bits,
                and so relocatable io space behind such a
                bridge shall be of the form
                0000.0000.0000.0000.aaaa.aa00.aaaa.aaaa"
            - p21, l39 insert after ")."  "The size of the allocated
                space for a base register or register pair shall be the
                maximum of the size indicated by the base address
                register or register pair and the size reported
                by the 'reg' property."
            - p20, l26-p21, l46 ("Enter... ) move to end of
                section 2.5
            - p20, l22 replace "with PCI" with "with one or more

            - p20, l25 replace entire sentence "Interpret ..."
                with "Interprets FCode for all built in PCI slots.
                For each of the system's built in PCI domains
                perform  the pci-probing algorithm as shown
                in section 2.5."
            - p14, l28 replace line with "The Open Firmware driver
                for a PCI domain shall probe its plug-in slots
                according to the following algortihm."
            - Add:

                1.2 References

                [1]  IEEE Std 1275-1994 Standard for Boot (Initialization,
                Configuration) Firmware, Core Practices and Requirements.
                [2]  PCI Local Bus Specification, Revision 2.1, June 1, 1995.
                [3]  PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture Specification, Revision 
		     1.0, April 5, 1994.
                [4]  Open Firmware Recommended Practice:  Generic Names

            - Replace the "name" portion of section 4.1.1 with:

                "name"

                Standard prop-name, defines device's name.

                prop-encoded-array:  device name, encoded as with encode-string.

                For devices with FCode, the name is defined by the FCode
                program.  In accordance with the Generic Names Recommended
                Practice [4], it should represent the general nature of the
                device.

                For devices without FCode, the name is derived from the PCI
                Class Code, as described in section 2.5.

            - Replace the "compatible" portion of section 4.1.1 with:

                "compatible"
 
                Standard prop-name, defines devices with which this device is
                compatible.

                prop-encoded-array:  The concatenation, with encode+, of
                an arbitrary number of text strings, each encoded with
                encode-string.

                As defined in [1] and [4], this property lists devices with
                which this device is compatible.

                Note 1:  It is better to identify the function as a whole,
                instead of identifying only the "chip" that is directly
                connected to the PCI bus (e.g.:  use "IBM,v915" instead
                of "S3,928") because there may be numerous other display
                adapters that use the same graphics chip, but which are
                not entirely compatible due to the presence of different
                support chips like DACs and programmable clock generators.

                Note 2:  Devices with FCode may put a name of the form
                pciVVVV,DDDD) in "compatible" if they present the same 
                interface that the non-FCode algorithm (section 2.5) does.

            - In section 2.5, under probe-pci, change the "name" paragraph to
              be "compatible" instead, and add before it a new "name" 
	      paragraph:

                "name"  Based on the PCI Class Code register, pick a name from
                the following table.  If none apply, generate a name of the
                form "pciVVVV,DDDD" as described below under "compatible".

            Amendments:
                - Change textual representation (7.2.1) from "main"
                  to "0" and from "aux" to "1"
                - Should call out all of the methods and properties
                  (incl reg)
                - "slot-names" should be consistent with the PCI
                  binding (needs bit mask)
        Withdrawn by author; AI to Converge with CHRP 8042 binding
            and resubmit.

    #345: CS4231 Device Binding
            Amendments:
                - xctl0/1 typos -- control line 0, bit #
                - Confirm devices that 423x applies to
        Accepted unanimously; Editor directed to produce Approved
            Version 1.0 with above amendments

                - Contents of 7.2.1 go away
                - Tag the layout as optional (if the firmware knows)
                - Section 9 use "shall" as appropriate
                - Section 9.3 -- delete or reword since the
                  implication is that Open Firmware must figure out
                  what to do with respect to the indicator state when
                  enter is pressed.
        Withdrawn by author; to be resubmitted

    #348: PC Serial Port Device Binding
            Amendments:
                - Add reference to pnpPNP,501
                - Clock frequency should be in hertz
                - Pick up methods from CHRP serial device binding
                  (or move to DSE)
        Accepted unanimously; Editor directed to produce Approved
            Version 1.0 with above amendments; AI to suggest "name"
            convention to recognize superio chips

Device Support Extensions version 0.6
    #334: (posting)
        Closed administratively
    #342: Clarify Scope
        Amendments:
            - Convert to Recommended Practice and update Scope section

              of "property name"
            - Clarify what the interpertation is for "#x-channels" (each
              integer specifies the possible number of channels supported
              in a specific mode of the device. E.g, a 1 indicates
              monophonic, 2 indicates stereophonic)
            - "sample-frame-size" needs clarification (bits or bytes)
        Tabled unanimously; tighten definitions

              line 39 through line 14 of p11.  Create a property
              "pnp-id" its value is 2 encoded as with encode string as
              shown on page 11, line 27-41 (line 32 should be ascii and
              the VVV should be "uppercase ascii" instead of 5-bit
            - Propose lines 25, 28 of p9, lower case m before all "n"s,
              line 25 "i" in brackets (add text to explain why optional)
