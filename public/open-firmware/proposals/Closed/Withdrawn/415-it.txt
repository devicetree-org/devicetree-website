Subject: Item #415: Re: Item #414: PCI-IDE device binding (overview)


With respect to item #414: PCI-IDE device binding (overview),
we would like to suggest two small changes. 

With respect to the reg property, we should not limit the number of
entries to six.

Some IDE bus controllers (e.g. Winbond) have a sixth base address
register at offset 0x24 which is used for PIO mode disk drives. This
register if present, should be in the reg property (last) which would
make the total number of entries in the reg property seven, not
six. It has already been shown that systems that use these IDE
controllers with an appropriate seven entry reg property work well
with MacOS.

With respect to node properties, we should document all of the
required properties.
    
MacOS requires a "compatible" property with a value of "chrp,ide" to
be present in the "pci-ide" node as well as in the "ide" nodes (unless
that has changed recently). These should be documented in this binding
as well for completeness.

Mark.
