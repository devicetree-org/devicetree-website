In reply to the attached note:

>>>Ron et al

I am a little confused by the wording of this proposal.  I hope that
you intend this to document an optional extention, required for MAC OS
support, that is how the main body (new section) reads.

 However, the section:

> >>> replace line 42 of page 56 with:
> 
>     =80 MacOS Heirarchical File System

is not stated as an option, it is one of the 4 types that are required
to be supported by all chrp platforms.  We have a problem with this as
manditory.

Also the section:

> 
> >>> add new table entry for Table 1, page 18, under Any block device:
> 
>     <i>device</i>:<i>partition</i>,:????    Mac HFS file system
> 
> Note: ???? is TBD, hopefully by meeting time.

while not stating explicity that the support is manditory, the
description on lines 37-39 implies this when it uses the very ugly
word "guarantee".  

I hope that we can clean this up.  I think that such an option should
be documented in the CHRP binding, I just can not agree to a new
manditory facility.
