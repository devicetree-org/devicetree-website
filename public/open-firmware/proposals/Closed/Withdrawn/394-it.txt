Subject: Item #394: ISA bus: Typo in binding - "interrupts"

P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #394 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:		Typo in ISA binding "interrupts"

Author:		Mitch Bradley

Date:		October 17, 1996

Ed/Tech:	Editorial

Synopsis:	Typo in ISA binding "interrupts"

Doc & Version:	ISA Bus binding rev. 0.2 DRAFT

Problem:	For the "interrupts" property, type codes 2 and 3 are
		listed as having the same meaning.  That is wrong; one
		should be falling edge and the other should be rising
		edge.
Proposal:	

		In section 4.1.1 on page 15, change line 53 from:

			3 = high to low edge sensitive type enabled
		to
			3 = low to high edge sensitive type enabled
