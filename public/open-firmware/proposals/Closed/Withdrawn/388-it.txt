P1275 Open Firmware Working Group Proposal -- Proposal #388 Ver <Auth-Vers#>

Title:          Request for email balloting of Proposal 250

Author:         John Kingman

Date:           August 23, 1996

Ed/Tech:        Procedural

Synopsis:       It's time we had an email balloting procedure.

Proposal:       

Proposal #250 indicates that any eligible member can request email balloting
of a properly submitted proposal.  Since Proposal #250 was submitted properly,
I am requesting email balloting of it, to test out the procedure.
