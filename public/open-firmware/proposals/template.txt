Instructions for submitting proposals to the IEEE Open Firmware Working Group:

1.  Using the template, above, fill in the any fields enclosed in
    <angle brackets>. Do not include these instructions in
    your proposal. The Author-version# field can be set to 1
    if the field doen't apply.

2.  If the proposal does not contain any attachments, then
    send the proposal to p1275-proposal-xxx@gramercy.eng.sun.com
    (NB: Remove '-xxx' to use email address.)

	NB: See the information at the end of the document if
	    your proposal contains attachments. Do not send
	    proposals with attachments to the address shown above.
	    Send the proposal and all information to the administrator
	    (Currently: dmk-xxx@Eng.Sun.Com).
	    (Remove '-xxx' to use email address.)

    Put a short name of the proposal in the subject line
    making sure to include the document name in the begining
    of the subject line of the mail message:

    Subject: PCI Binding: Specify order of reg properties
    Subject: Core Errata: Logic error in pathname resolution
    Subject: Device Ext: Create property to identify wide scsi adaptors

    The auto-generated proposal summary includes the number
    and subject line and is used in various auto-generated reports.

The proposal number generator will log the incoming message to an internal
file (in case there's a problem with the script), automatically assign a
proposal item number to the incoming proposal, edit the message as follows:

        - Prepend "Item %N%" to the Subject line.
        - Replace all instances of %N% with the assigned item number.
        - Item-stamp and time-stamp the message at the bottom of the file.

The updated proposal is logged to another internal file, then saved
to a file named "P1275.proposals/Item.<assigned-number>" and the
updated subject line is saved to a proposal summary file.

The summary file and proposal text files will be posted to playground
on an occaisional basis.

Note: Posting deadlines:

      Proposals can be submitted at any time, but should be submitted
      at least one week prior to a working group meeting, to assure
      that the proposal gets discussed at that working group meeting.

Note: Proposals with attachments:

      Proposals with attachments (postscript, pdf or large attachments)
      should be sent directly to dmk-xxx@Eng.Sun.Com for proper handling and
      posting, WELL IN ADVANCE of the proposal posting deadline.

      The attachments and the proposal will be properly posted and handled
      by the administrator. Follow all other directions except instead
      of sending it to the proposal filter, send it to dmk-xxx@Eng.Sun.Com

     NB: Remove '-xxx' to use email addresses.
