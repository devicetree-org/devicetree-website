**Where can I find the latest version of the Devicetree Specification?**

You can always find the latest released, as well as all older releases, in our GitHub repository:

We’re planning to make a v1.0 release once we have enough contributions to make a major release.

No. Changes to the spec are proposed and discussed on a [public mailing list](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#devicetree-spec) and the source document is hosted in the [Devicetree Specification](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification) project on GitHub.

You can find details about the mailing list and submission process in the [Readme](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/master/README.md) file.
